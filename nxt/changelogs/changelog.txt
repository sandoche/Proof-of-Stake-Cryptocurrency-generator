Performance optimizations of derived table trimming and pruning, should fix the
issues some nodes encounter with these database operations taking too long.

Other minor bugfixes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.11.8:

Transaction Scheduler improvements and bugfixes.

Added deleteScheduledTransaction API.

Allow getting all scheduled transactions when no account id is specified in
getScheduledTransactions.

Added Scheduled Transactions page. Allow deleting scheduled transactions from
the client UI.

Added fake tokens warnings.

Display transactions in the block info modal according to their natural order
and mark phased transactions. Added "executed phased" tab.

Added ability to search by block height from the client search box.

Add validate passphrase modal to give users another chance to validate their
passphrase after login.

Passphrase recovery tool will now search for a single typo in any position, in
case no specific position is specified, and will also work for accounts without
a public key.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.11.7:

This release adds the ability to submit a JLRDA purchase transaction from the
IGNIS Token Sale page even before the sell offer has been published. Such
transactions are not broadcasted immediately, but held in memory and only
sent out when the expected sell offer arrives in the unconfirmed transaction
pool. For this to work, you must keep the node running after submitting the
purchase transaction, until the sell offer has been received and processed.

Note that after submitting a purchase transaction in advance of the sell
offer, you will get a pop-up that your currency buy order has been submitted,
but it will not show in the unconfirmed pool. This is normal as such advance
orders are kept separately.

This functionality is currently available for full nodes only, i.e. those
that have downloaded the full blockchain. Users of light clients can submit
JLRDA purchase transactions only after the sell offer has been accepted in a
block. To switch from a light client to full node, set nxt.isLightClient=false
in conf/nxt.properties, and wait for the blockchain to download.


More IGNIS Token Sale UI bugfixes and improvements:

Add paging buttons to the exchange history table on the Ignis page.

Initialize the JLRDA units field to 0.

Fixed "calculate fee" when connecting to a remote node with remembered
passphrase.

Implemented TransactionScheduler, added ScheduleCurrencyBuy and
GetScheduledTransactions APIs.

ScheduleCurrencyBuy API accepts same parameters as CurrencyBuy API, and an
additional offerIssuer parameter. Instead of broadcasting the prepared
transaction immediately, it schedules it to be broadcast as soon as an
unconfirmed currency exchange offer transaction from that issuer, for that
currency and a sell rate not higher than the requested, arrives in the
unconfirmed transaction pool. The broadcast parameter must be set to false.
This API requires a full node (not a light client) and admin password unless
running on localhost.

GetScheduledTransactions API returns a list of all scheduled transactions for
a given account.

Note that these APIs were specifically added for the purpose of the IGNIS
Token Sale, and may be removed or modified in the future.


Other fixes and improvements:

Allow blacklisting the real remote host, not the proxy, when running a public
node behind a reverse proxy. Use the nxt.forwardedForHeader property to
configure the header added by the proxy to the API http requests (normally
X-Forwarded-For).

Fixed printing of paper wallet for passphrases containing special characters.

WARNING: If you printed out a paper wallet for an account passphrase which
contains special characters using an earlier release, this passphrase may have
been printed out incorrectly, with those characters missing, or truncated. In
this case you are advised to print out a correct copy using this version. The
QR codes were not affected by this bug, and neither were the standard account
passphrases generated by the client.

Also note that some long passphrases may be cut off by your printer unless
page size is adjusted to width.

ALWAYS VERIFY THAT THE PRINTED PASSPHRASE IS CORRECT BEFORE RELYING ON A PAPER
WALLET AS YOUR ONLY BACKUP!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.11.6:

IMPORTANT LICENSING CHANGE:

The Nxt software is now distributed under the Jelurida Public License (JPL)
version 1.0 for the Nxt Public Blockchain Platform. The full text of the JPL
is in the LICENSE.txt file (use JPL-NRS.pdf for a printable version).

The client UI remains under the MIT license.

This release is a mandatory upgrade. A hard fork will be scheduled at the
Ardor Genesis Snapshot block, expected to be set some time after the end of
the IGNIS token sale. At that time, nodes running 1.11.5 or older will be left
on a fork.

Added IGNIS Token Sale page. See https://www.jelurida.com/ico for latest token
sale terms and schedule.

Added support for the Changelly cryptocurrency exchange.

Added code to disable trading or transferring of assets that will be migrated
to Ardor after the Ardor Genesis Snapshot, and delete open ask/bid orders for
them at that time. Currently such assets and their ids are:

ARDR: 12422608354438203866
Bitswift: 12034575542068240440
Janus: 4348103880042995903
JanusXT: 14572747084550678873
ComJNSXT: 13363533560620557665

Added support for printing a "paper wallet" when creating a new account and
from the account details modal.

Added a custom installer panel that allows to: shutdown NXT server if it is
running; remove existing installation; customize conf/nxt.properties by
choosing from a fixed set of settings.

The pre-defined installer settings are taken from property files under
conf/examples. The installer makes sure no settings are in conflict.

Added password recovery tool for brute forcing partially forgotten or mistyped
passphrases. Use the passwordRecovery.sh or passwordRecovery.bat script to run,
after first setting the known password text fragments and guesses dictionary in
nxt.properties. See nxt-default.properties for configuration details.

Added ability to display a custom warning message on the login screen,
configurable as nxt.customLoginWarning.

Added active shufflings notification in the header bar.

Added image loading progress bar to the lock screen.

Performance optimizations when under higher transaction load.

Monetary System UI improvements and bugfixes.

API gzip filter is now automatically enabled for open API nodes, unless
explicitly disabled in nxt.enableAPIServerGZIPFilter.

Support running Nxt as a Windows service.

Updated mobile app to latest Cordova Android platform.

Added IntelliJ IDE project files to folder ./ide/intellij/project, developers 
working on the source code should copy the content of folder 
./ide/intellij/project to the root folder of the project and open the project 
from inside IntelliJ using File-Open for the project root folder. 
The IntelliJ project is pre-configured with the necessary dependencies to build 
and run the Java source code.
To copy the IntelliJ files to the project root folder, open a command prompt
at the project root folder and issue the following command:
Windows: xcopy /e/k/s/h ide\intellij\project .
Linux: cp -r ide/intellij/project/. .

Updated H2 to version 1.4.196, bouncy castle to 1.57, and jetty to 9.3.20.
Delete the old lib folder first if unpacking on top.

Added "Copy Account" button next to the account id header.

Added again the API and DBShell links to the cogwheel menu.

Minor bugfixes and UI improvements.

Android App updated to use Apache Cordova 6.4.0.

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.15, Bouncy Castle to 1.56, slf4j to 1.7.22, and
zxing to 3.3.0, delete the old lib folder before unpacking on top.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.11.1e:

Implemented "Store Remembered Passphrase" setting in the device settings page.
When checked, the client stores the remembered passphrase in the local browser
settings or mobile app settings so that the next time the client is launched
it will login in automatically.
For the mobile app this setting defaults to true. In other configurations it 
defaults to false. The stored passphrase is deleted when logging out of the
wallet.

Desktop Application now supports request confirmations when running as light or
roaming client.

Sign Transaction modal now signs the transaction bytes on the client side.

When the mobile app cannot connect to a randomly selected remote node, it will
popup the device settings modal to allow the user to configure a specific node.

When the mobile device is offline, the device settings modal allows signing
transactions and generating tokens to support cold storage functionality.

Additional client side bug fixes and refactoring.

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.14 and H2 to version 1.4.193, delete the old lib
folder before unpacking on top.

Updated localization component i18next to version 3.4.4


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.11.0e:

Added Generators page (under the cogwheel menu), showing the predicted next
block generators.

When working as a roaming or light client, data returned by the remote node is 
validated against other remote nodes. In case of a difference a visual 
indication is displayed on the toolbar to warn the user that the data returned 
by the remote node may not be consistent.

The user interface files are now located under html/www instead of html/ui,
as this is the path required by the Apache Cordova framework used by the
mobile wallet.

The lockup screen now displays a button group of "by account", "by passphrase", 
"by QR code" login options side by side above the credentials entry field, 
instead of the old "By Account" / "By Password" toggle button.

Scanning a QR code for login, has been implemented by clicking the QR code icon
on the lockup screen. When the value scanned matches an NXT account format it
will be treated as account login, otherwise the value scanned will be treated
as the account passphrase.

The old "Remember Account" and "Remember Passphrase" checkboxes were merged 
into a single "Remember Me" checkbox.

Save passphrase in local storage when using passphrase login with "Remember Me"
checked. Choosing logout will clear this data.

Account and passphrase entry fields on modal dialogs now support scanning the
value from a QR code by clicking the QR link above the field.

When logging in with passphrase and the "Remember Me" checkbox checked, the 
"Account Details" modal will display the QR code for the account passphrase 
in addition to the QR code for the account id.

Experimental support for running the client wallet as a mobile app has been 
added. See specific documentation at https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/Mobile_App

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.13, delete the old lib folder before unpacking on
top.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.10.3:

Removed old code, the Ardor distribution UI, and the getFxtQuantity API, as the
Ardor distribution is now complete.

Blacklist peers of version older than 1.10.1.

As a performance optimization, the ARDR asset distribution data is now loaded
from the conf/fxt.json for production and conf/fxt-testnet.json files for
testnet, instead of being recalculated during blockchain download. If those
files are missing, and a rescan or redownload is performed, snapshot data will
be calculated again and saved as the corresponding json file in the nxt folder,
thus allowing independent validation of the hardcoded distribution data.

Added ShapeShift support to the desktop wallet by using a proxy servlet on the
local node.

The security manager which is automatically enabled when add-ons are in use now
allows add-on network connections.

Added nxt.disableSecurityPolicy property to disable the security manager even
when add-ons are in use, in order to improve performance, default false.

Added nxt.keyStoreType property to configure the keystore type used, default
is JKS.

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.12 and Bouncy Castle to version 1.55, delete the
old lib folder before unpacking on top.


Important copyright change:

The copyright of all GPLv2 code contributed by the Nxt Core Developers to the
Nxt Reference Software now belongs to Jelurida IP B.V., a private company
registered in the Netherlands. Please contact info@jelurida.com for commercial
licensing options if the GPLv2 license does not fit your private blockchain
needs.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.10.2:

Changed default setting of nxt.apiServerCORS to true in nxt-default.properties,
to enable cross origin filter on the API server by default.

Added CORS peer service field, showing whether CORS is enabled for open API
nodes.

Recalculate NRS.isLocalhost when api proxy is enabled and blockchain download
has finished. Fixed starting funding monitor when running on remote host.

To protect against brute force attacks on the admin password of public nodes,
after 3 unsuccessful login attempts the remote host is blacklisted for 1 h.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.10.1:

This release adds transaction replay protection, to be enabled at the hard fork
scheduled for block 1,000,000. Upgrading to 1.10.1 or later before that block
is mandatory for all.

The ecBlockId and ecBlockHeight transaction fields, previously populated but
not used, will begin to be used for enforcing that a transaction submitted on
one blockchain or fork will not be accepted on another blockchain or fork that
shares the same code. These fields by default will be set to a block 720 blocks
behind the last block at the time the transaction is created, and transactions
will only be accepted if their ecBlockId and ecBlockHeight values point to an
existing block when they are included in the blockchain. This default setting
provides protection against replaying the transaction on a hard fork that has
diverged more than 720 blocks from the one where the transaction was created.

Light clients that have no way of verifying the ecBlock values returned by a
remote node will use hardcoded values, to be updated manually at some releases.
Transactions from legacy light clients that leave eBlockId and height set to 0
will still be accepted, but cannot benefit from such replay protection.

All CreateTransaction APIs now accept additional ecBlockId and ecBlockHeight
parameters, allowing the default values to be overridden by the client.

Minor bugfixes and UI improvements.

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.11, delete the old lib folder before unpacking on
top.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.10.0e:

This is an experimental release introducing the new light client and roaming
client features.

The roaming client feature, enabled by default, makes the client immediately
usable by forwarding API requests that need the full blockchain to a randomly
chosen peer (remote node), selected to provide the openAPI service. As all html
and javascript files are still served locally and not from the remote host,
this is considerably safer than just using a remote node. Outgoing transactions
are also signed locally, never sending the secret phrase to the remote peer.

This roaming client (API Proxy) mode is used automatically while the blockchain
is still downloading, with a switch to full client mode once the download is
complete.
It can be disabled by setting nxt.enableAPIProxy=false in nxt.properties.
For openAPI nodes, the API proxy remains disabled, ignoring this setting. For
light clients, the API proxy is always enabled.

The light client feature, disabled by default, makes the node run in roaming
mode permanently, without downloading the blockchain at all. It can be enabled
by setting nxt.isLightClient=true.
Light clients are not advertised as providing openAPI service even if they do
have their API publicly accessible.

The remote node to use when in roaming and light client modes is selected
randomly, but can be changed manually in the UI, or using the new
setAPIProxyPeer API, or forced to a specific peer using the
nxt.forceAPIProxyServerURL property.

Remote nodes can be blacklisted from the UI, or using the blacklistAPIProxyPeer
API. This blacklisting is independent from peer blacklisting. The API proxy
blacklisting period can be set using the nxt.apiProxyBlacklistingPeriod
property (default 1800000 milliseconds).

API requests that require sending the secret phrase, shared key, or admin
password to the server, for features like forging, shuffling, or running a
funding monitor, are disabled when in roaming or light client mode.

While a remote node cannot steal your secret phrase, and data returned by such
nodes is escaped to prevent javascript injection attacks, users must be aware
that the validity of such data cannot be verified. For example, a rogue remote
node can still return fake asset exchange recent trades or open orders prices,
or modified voting system poll options and descriptions.

To force using a remote node for testing APIs, the /test-proxy URL can be used
instead of /test for the API test page, i.e. http://localhost:7876/test-proxy.

A new sendTransaction API has been added, similar to broadcastTransaction but
without validating the transaction, without re-broadcasting the transaction and
without adding it locally as unconfirmed transaction. This API is mostly useful
for light or roaming clients that cannot validate or accept locally unconfirmed
transactions, but must nevertheless be able to send such to peers.

A new getNextBlockGenerators API has been added, returning the next block
generators ordered by hit time. The list of currently active forgers is first
initialized using the block generators with at least 2 blocks generated within
the previous 10,000 blocks, excluding accounts without a public key. The list
is updated as new blocks are processed. The results are not 100% correct since
previously active generators may no longer be running and new generators won't
be known until they generate a block.

Added a peer info modal. Minor other UI improvements and bugfixes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.9.2:

This is the first stable release in the 1.9 series. Update to this release on
mainnet is optional up until block 1000000 (Oct 12), however users are advised
to do it earlier, as after July 14th updating will trigger a blockchain rescan.

The main new feature in 1.9 is the distribution of ARDR assets. See the 1.9.0e
changelog for details.

Performance optimizations for blockchain rescans and for snapshot balance
calculations. Added nxt.dbMaxMemoryRows property to allow setting the H2
MAX_MEMORY_ROWS parameter.

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.10, delete the old lib folder before unpacking on
top.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.9.1e:

Fixed a client UI bug affecting some form submission.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.9.0e:

This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
optional for main net.

This release enables taking multiple snapshots of accounts NXT balances, every
60 blocks, for a period of 90 days, and distributing an ARDR token based on the
average of those balances, at the end of the snapshot, to be used for the Ardor
consensus chain token distribution in Nxt 2.0.

On testnet, the snapshot will start at block 649400 and end at block 779000
(June 24).
On mainnet, the snapshot will start at block 870400 (expected July 14) and end
at block 1000000 (Oct 12).

Since on testnet the starting block is in the past, on upgrade to this release
a blockchain rescan will be performed automatically in order to calculate past
account balances. Those who delay upgrading their mainnet nodes until after
block 870400 will also experience such a rescan. However, the hard fork block
is set at the end of the snapshot, so the final deadline for upgrading to 1.9
is at blocks 779000 and 1000000 respectively.

To get your ARDR tokens, it is essential that you keep your NXT balance in your
own account. There is no need to run a node or forge. It is the confirmed NXT
balance that is used for the snapshot, not the unconfirmed (available) balance,
so having some NXT locked in open AE bid orders, shufflings, etc, will not
affect your ARDR distribution. For balances on exchange accounts, it will be up
to each exchange to handle the re-distribution of the ARDR tokens that will get
automatically sent to the exchange account at snapshot end.

A new getFxtQuantity API has been added, which allows retrieving the already
accumulated ARDR quantity for each account during the snapshot, and an estimate
for the quantity yet to be obtained. While snapshots are done every 60 blocks,
the numbers that this API returns are updated once every 720 blocks only.

Snapshot balances used for the ARDR distribution for a specific account can be
recorded in the log by setting the nxt.logFxtBalance property to that account
number, and performing a rescan if the snapshot has already started.

Added some additional transaction bytes validation, and phasing parameters
validation, to take effect after the hardfork.

Added getAssetDividends API, to retrieve the dividend payment history for an
asset. It can be viewed in the client by clicking on the new "View Asset
Dividends" link on the asset exchange page. Dividend payments made before a
node is updated to 1.9.0e will not show in this history, unless a blockchain
rescan is forced manually.

After the hardfork block, asset dividend payment transactions will be limited
to not more than one per asset every 60 blocks.

Added a new Messages table in the client UI. Allowed uploading a file as a
message attachment, plain or encrypted, and downloading such messages as files.
All create transaction APIs that support prunable message attachments now also
optionally accept multipart file uploads as messageFile or messageToEncryptFile
parameters, or when using client-side encrypted data the data part can also be
uploaded using encryptedMessageFile parameter. As the test API page does not
support multiple file upload parameters, upload buttons for those are not
currently available there.

Accept sharedKey parameter in downloadPrunableMessage and getPrunableMessage
APIs.

Added client UI support for decrypting messages using a shared key, to allow
disclosing the shared key for a specific encrypted message to a third party in
order to decrypt it without having to reveal the account passphrase.

Forging optimization to reduce block skipping when switching forks.

Minor other bugfixes and UI improvements.

Updated H2 library to version 1.4.192, tika to 1.13, and slf4j to 1.7.21. If
installing manually, make sure to delete the old lib folder first.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.8.3:

This release contains a number of improvements and bugfixes.

API changes:

Optional includeHoldingInfo parameter added to the GetAccountLedgerEntry and
GetAccountLedgerEntry APIs.


UI improvements:

Account switch no longer reloads the wallet.

Numeric decimal position, thousands separator and date formats are now locale 
based. The default browser locale language is used by default. A new 
"Regional Format" client side setting provides the ability to override the
default.

Numeric formatting is now implemented for most table columns which display NXT
amounts or holding amounts. The number of decimals positions in each cell is
calculated according to the largest number of decimals required and zeros are
padded to the right.

Amounts specified in NXT are limited to the number of decimal positions
specified by the "Maximum NXT decimal positions" client setting. The default 
behavior is to display two digits after the decimal position.

UI improvements for transaction tables, displayed in the dashboard and other
pages. Height column was added as a link to the block in which the transaction
is included.

Starting the wallet on a specific asset page is now supported.


Desktop Wallet:

Right click functionality for copy/cut/paste of input fields and copy of label
text is now enabled. Right click menu on the asset exchange left pane is
enabled.

Entering admin password in the UI settings is no longer required when using the
desktop wallet.


Upgraded jetty to version 9.3.9, make sure to delete old lib folder first if
updating manually.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.8.2:

This is a bugfix release. All users running 1.8.0e or 1.8.1 should upgrade.

Added html escaping of product names for marketplace recent listings.

Fixed marketplace listing for items without image.

Only show completed purchases in recent purchases.

Implemented import contacts for the desktop wallet UI.

Other minor UI improvements and bugfixes.

Allow absolute paths for keystore file location in nxt.keyStorePath property.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.8.1:

This is the first stable release in the 1.8 series. Please also read the 1.8.0e
changelog for all new features and changes since 1.7.5. This release does not
require a hard fork and upgrading to it is optional. It will not do a rescan
either, but once upgraded to 1.8.1, going back to older version requires
downloading the blockchain again or restoring the nxt_db folder from backup.


API enhancements:

Added getSharedKey API, to allow calculating the one-time shared key used for
encryption of messages. Parameters are the secret phrase for one of the
accounts, the other account, and the nonce used in the message encryption.

The readMessage API now also supports decryption of encrypted message parts
using the shared key, as provided by the above getSharedKey API, instead of the
secret phrase. An optional retrieve parameter is also supported to request
automatic retrieval of pruned message parts from archival nodes.

The getDGSPurchase API now supports decryption of the purchased goods, using
either the secret phrase of the buyer or seller, or the shared key from the
getSharedKey API.

The getBalance API now supports an optional height parameter to retrieve account
balance at previous heights, if still available.

The getPolls and getAllShufflings APIs now support an optional finishedOnly
parameter, to retrieve only polls or shufflings that have already completed.


Add-on framework improvements:

Add-ons can now register their own http API request handlers, allowing custom
request types to be supported. Overriding existing client APIs is not allowed.
See the example add-on nxt.addons.PopOffCounter. Such APIs must be tagged with
APITag.ADDONS and will appear under "Add-ons" on the API test page.

The add-on framework supporting custom APIs, in combination with the client-side
plugin system, present an opportunity for developers to add functionality to
the NRS without having to modify core code. Add-on developers should be aware
that the Java API in 2.0 will undergo many changes, and add-ons code will have
to be updated. And users are again reminded to only install and run add-ons
from trusted sources.


UI improvements:

Added pagination to the recent marketplace listings and recent purchases pages.

Added finished polls and finished shufflings tables under the active polls and
active shufflings respectively, with pagination. A "view" action for polls now
makes it easy to view the results of an active or finished poll.

Added full-size image display in a new modal, when clicking on an image in the
marketplace listings or purchase modal.

Other minor bugfixes and improvements.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.8.0e:

This is an experimental release. It adds several new features, which however do
not require a hard fork.


JavaFX UI:

A desktop wallet UI, mostly equivalent to the in-browser UI, is launched on
supported platforms automatically when the server is started by clicking on
the Nxt desktop icon or start menu shortcut.

More details about the JavaFX UI are available at:
https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issues/338/desktop-wallet

The property nxt.defaultDesktopAccount can be used to specify an account to
login to automatically once the desktop wallet loads.

The desktop wallet UI can be disabled by setting
nxt.launchDesktopApplication=false

The pre-compiled package will still run if JavaFX is not available, but to
recompile the code on such platforms the compile-nojfx.sh script must be used,
which skips the compilation of the desktop wallet.

The installer now creates a start and stop menu shortcuts and desktop icons on
Unix platforms too, which start the NRS client in desktop mode. From the
command line, use the new start.sh script to start the client in desktop mode,
and the corresponding stop.sh script to stop it. The start.sh and stop.sh
scripts can be run from any directory.

The jar installer package has been replaced with a self-extracting shell script
package nxt-client-1.8.0e.sh, which Unix users can just run, or click on, in
order to launch the installer. An advantage of using the installer instead of
the zip package is that the installer will create the above mentioned menu
shortcuts and desktop icons, and will also automatically remove old libraries
from previous installations in the same directory.

A known bug (of IzPack it seems) is that on Unix the installer fails to create
desktop icons when installing in a not yet existing target directory. It will
also fail to remove old menu shortcuts and desktop icons, so first running an
uninstall of a previous installation is still advisable.

Incompatible change:

Note that when run in desktop mode on Unix and Mac, the ~/.nxt directory is now 
used to store configuration files, logs, and the nxt_db blockchain database. 
This makes it simpler to upgrade to a new version, by deleting the content of 
the old nxt installation directory, as no user configuration files or database 
files are stored in it.

The run.sh script continues to use command line mode, i.e. does not attempt to
start the desktop wallet and desktop tray icon, and continues to use the nxt
installation directory from within which it must be run to store the nxt_db
database, logs, and configuration files. Users who want to use desktop mode but
still use the nxt installation directory instead of ~/.nxt for those files can
use the run-desktop.sh script instead.


Funding Monitor:

The new Funding Monitor feature provides monitoring account balances, and their
automated replenishment from a funding account, based on account properties set
by the funding account to the monitored accounts.

NXT, asset, or currency balances can be monitored. If a balance falls below
the configured threshold, a transaction will be submitted to transfer units
from the funding account to the monitored account. A transfer will remain
pending if the number of blocks since the previous transfer transaction is less
than the interval configured for the monitor.

The APIs for the Funding Monitor feature are StartFundingMonitor,
GetFundingMonitor, and StopFundingMonitor. Detailed documentation for those is
provided in the API javadoc files. A user interface for setting and viewing
currently running Funding Monitors is accessible from under the cogwheel menu.


Client UI page or modal redirection. By adding page or modal parameters to the
http://localhost:7876/index.html URL, the client can be redirected to open a
specific page or modal pop-up, with pre-populated parameter values.
For usage example, see:
https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/pull-requests/42/added-page-redirect-modal-popup-with

The Marketplace has been enhanced by adding recent listings and recent
purchases tables, showing the last 10 goods listed or purchased.

Marketplace listings now can have images. Image files are uploaded as prunable
unencrypted binary message attachments to the DGSListing transaction. A new
messageFile file parameter has been added to the dgsListing API, to allow
direct upload of files as multipart form data. This parameter is also supported
by all createTransaction APIs which allow message attachments, but is not
exposed on their /test API pages.

Image attachments that have been pruned are retrieved automatically from
archival nodes when the user views the page.

A new downloadPrunableMessage API has been added, to allow downloading of
prunable message attachments directly as binary data. An optional secretPhrase
parameter is supported, to allow decryption and downloading of the encrypted
part of the message instead of the plain text part.

The nxt.apiSSLCiphers property can be used to select which SSL ciphers should
be enabled for the API server when using SSL.

Unless overridden in nxt.myPlatform, the real system platform is now shown in
the peer info, as found in the java os.platform and os.arch system properties.

Other minor bugfixes and optimizations.

Updated jetty to version 9.3.8, lucene to 5.3.2, tika to 1.12, and slf4j to
1.7.18. Delete the old lib directory first when installing manually on top of a
previous installation. If using the installer, old libraries will be deleted
automatically, as well as any existing files under the classes and html
directories, excluding html/ui/plugins.


Server-side add-ons:

It is now possible to trigger script execution, or really add any custom Java
code to the server, by writing a class which implements the nxt.addons.AddOn
interface, making sure it is on the classpath, and enabling it by adding its
name to the nxt.addOns property. See the example add-ons in the nxt.addons
package. The AfterStart and BeforeShutdown add-ons can be used to trigger
scripts to be run just after the server has started, and just before shutdown.
Java source files for add-ons can be placed under addons/src to be compiled with
the compile.sh script, and the resulting class files under addons/classes will
be included on the classpath at runtime.

This is an unsupported feature for developers only. While in the 1.x series
the Java API is expected to be stable, it will undergo significant refactoring
in 2.0. Keep any custom add-on code simple, and be prepared to have to change it
for 2.0 or discard it. It should also be obvious that such custom Java code can
crash your node or have unexpected side effects.

Malicious add-ons installed under the classes directory can easily get access
to your secret phrase. For add-ons installed under addons/classes, this has been
made more difficult, but they could still do other malicious acts. Therefore,
do not install and run add-ons from untrusted sources.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.7.5:

Code cleanup and removal of logic no longer needed after the 1.7 hard fork has
been passed. Added checkpoint at block 622000.

Peers running versions older than 1.7 are now blacklisted.

Allow disabling of specific API or groups of API using the nxt.disabledAPIs and
nxt.disabledAPITags properties, each taking a list of API request names, or API
tag names, separated with ';'. For example:

nxt.disabledAPIs=startForging; startShuffler
nxt.disabledAPITags=Create Transaction; Tagged Data

will disable the startForging and startShuffler API, and all API that are listed
under the Create Transaction or Tagged Data tabs on the API test page.

The enabled/disabled status of each API or APITag is exposed in getConstants.

The client UI hides menus related to disabled API tags and the "Send NXT",
"Send Currency" and "Send Message" buttons are hidden automatically when
their corresponding API is disabled.

The getAccountLedger API has been fixed to always apply the firstIndex,
lastIndex pagination to the final list of entries matching the query, rather
than to all entries for the given account or based on block height.

Use fixed shuffling transaction timestamps. To prevent timestamp correlation
attacks, all shufflers now use the same transaction timestamp, set to the last
block timestamp.

Performance optimizations. Account public keys are now cached in memory. This
cache currently takes around 12 MB at most, and can be disabled by setting
nxt.enablePublicKeyCache=false.

Back button added to the transaction info, account info, block info and ledger
info modals. Use the back button to return to the previous info modal.

Updated H2 to version 1.4.191. The MVStore storage engine is disabled by default
as it is still in beta, PageStore continues to be used. As this version no
longer accepts implicitly relative jdbc URLs, if you have configured a custom db
location in nxt.properties, make sure to prefix the path with ./ if it is not
absolute, e.g. nxt.dbUrl=jdbc:h2:./nxt_db/nxt... instead of
nxt.dbUrl=jdbc:h2:nxt_db/nxt... . If unpacking on top of existing installation,
delete the old lib folder first.

Token generation is now supported when using the "Remember Passphrase" option
and the NRS.signBytes() method now uses the remembered passphrase in case the
passphrase parameter is not specified.

The transition effect displayed when hiding the left menu was disabled since
it is causing UI rendering problems under certain conditions. 

"Switch Account" button added to the account info dialog. Clicking it would
switch the wallet to this account.

"Refresh Search Index" option added to the "Settings" menu. Use it to rebuild
the search index in case you are no longer getting correct search results.

Added UI for issuing singleton asset.

run.bat now works on Windows XP and Windows 2003. Database, configuration
files and logs are stored in the roaming folder under the user folder and
tray icon is operational.

Nodes that update from version older than 1.7.3e to this release after the hard
fork block will have blocks after 621000 deleted, to make sure they switch to
the 1.7.4 fork.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.7.4:

This is the first stable release in the 1.7 series. It is a mandatory update
for everyone. There is a hard fork scheduled for block 621000, estimated to
occur around Jan 21, 2016, at which new features will be enabled. Nodes that
do not update to 1.7.4 or later by this date will be left on a fork.

On testnet, the hard fork block is already passed, and all new features are
fully functional.

There were incompatible API changes introduced in the 1.6 series. API users
still on 1.5.15 and earlier should make sure to read the 1.6 series changelogs
and forum announcements, before upgrading to 1.7. These changes do not affect
regular end users who just run the NRS client on their desktop or VPS node.

The new features and improvements in the 1.7 series have been documented in
the 1.7.0e through 1.7.3e changelogs, available in the changelogs directory.


Here is a high level summary of the new features to be enabled after the
hard fork:

Coin Shuffling, a fully decentralized coin mixing, to improve account privacy.

Account Control for phased transactions, the Nxt equivalent of multisignature.

Immediate release of certain types of phased transactions on approval.

Improved block times, 60 s average, long block times now extremely unlikely.

Account Properties, assigning arbitrary name/value metadata to user accounts.

Singleton Assets, useful for representing single tradeable objects.

Dynamic fees, proportional to the relative transaction size.

Improved Exchange Booth UI.

Data Cloud, adding a UI and multiple enhancements to the existing Tagged Data
feature, to allow decentralized, censorship-free and tamper-proof publication
and retrieval of small files, documents, or arbitrary data. This feature is
not dependent on the hard fork and will be fully usable immediately on update
to this release.


Changes added since the 1.7.3e release:

Added detectMimeType utility API, allowing auto-detection of the mime type of
uploaded file or data, using the Apache Tika library.

The uploadTaggedData API now uses such mime type auto-detection to determine
the mime type of uploaded data when the user has not explicitly provided a
type parameter. It also automatically sets the isText property to true for
data of type text/plain only.

Made the maximum permitted number of forgers or shufflers running at the same
time configurable, default 100 each, using the nxt.maxNumberOfForgers and
nxt.maxNumberOfShufflers properties.

The default value of includeCounts parameter in the searchDGSGoods API is now
also false, this API was inadvertently missed when globally changing the
defaults to false in the 1.6 branch.

Various UI improvements.

Updated Bouncy Castle library to version 1.54.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.7.3e:

This is an experimental bugfix release. It is a mandatory update for testnet
nodes.

Added retrievePrunedTransaction API. This API can be used to force retrieval
of the prunable data for a given transaction, even if past the configured
nxt.maxPrunableLifetime. Using this API to retrieve pruned data however does
not increase its lifetime, i.e. at the next scheduled table trimming the data
will be pruned again if expired. This API queries all currently available
archival peers, until the missing data is found, therefore it can take some
time to complete, and can also return no results if there are no such peers
online, or none of them has the requested data. Consistent with the behavior
of getTransaction and related API, the returned transaction JSON will not have
the prunable parts included if they have already expired and
nxt.includeExpiredPrunable=false (default is true), but if those parts have
been successfully restored, they can be requested using the more specific APIs
such as getPrunableMessage, getTaggedData, etc.

The getPrunableMessage, getTaggedData, and downloadTaggedData APIs now support
optional "retrieve" parameter, default false. If the corresponding data has
been pruned and retrieve is true, an attempt will be made to retrieve the data
from archival peers, as if using the retrievePrunedTransaction API.

Added getReferencingTransactions API, returning the transactions referencing a
given transaction id.

Added getLinkedPhasedTransactions API, returning the phased transactions with
by-transaction voting model for a given linkedFullHash, regardless of their
phasing status (pending, approved or rejected). Since the corresponding table
is trimmed after finish height however, the result will not include those
transactions that finished before the last trimming height.

Increased maximum leasing period to 65535 blocks, to take effect after the
hard fork.

Shuffling UI improvements.

Added UI for the Tagged Data feature, now known as Data Cloud.

The Exchange Booth UI has been improved. The user must only enter the number
of currency units to be bought or sold, and the server determines the maximum
or minimum rate required in order to obtain or sell this amount, based on the
current market offers available. This avoids the creation of exchange requests
that cannot be filled, and eliminates the need for manually calculating the
required exchange rate.

To prevent clickjacking exploits, a new http header is now added by default to
all http API responses, X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN. This can be turned off by
setting nxt.apiFrameOptionsSameOrigin=false in nxt.properties.


Incompatible changes:

The taggedData field in the getAllTaggedData API response has been renamed to
data, for consistency with the other get*TaggedData APIs.

The behaviour of the currencyBuy API has been fixed, to exchange no more than
the number of currency units specified in the units parameter. Currently, the
total amount of NXT as calculated from rate * units is exchanged for currency,
even if this results in purchasing more than the number of units requested,
which is non intuitive and not consistent with the way currencySell works.
This change will take effect after the hard fork.


Updated Jetty to version 9.3.6 and slf4j to version 1.7.13. Make sure to
delete the old lib folder if unpacking over a previous installation.

This release will do a blockchain rescan on testnet and may delete blocks
after certain height, to resolve testnet forks.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.7.2e:

This is an experimental bugfix release. It is a mandatory update for testnet
nodes.

Accounts under phasing only control are not allowed to create or join
shufflings, or start shufflers.

Shuffling UI improvements. The My Shufflers page has been merged with
My Shufflings.

Added includeParticipantState parameter to getShufflers, to allow retrieving
shuffling participant state too with the same request.

The deleteAccountProperty API has been fixed to accept both recipient and
setter parameters, to be able to delete properties set to the account by
another account.

For consistency with setAccountProperty and deleteAccountProperty, the
getAccountProperties API account parameter has been renamed to recipient.
The account owner is also identified as recipient in the JSON fields of
the properties returned.

Added getAvailableToBuy and getAvailableToSell Monetary System APIs, to allow
calculating the rate required in order to completely fill an exchange request,
or the maximum available currency units or NXT amount considering the current
market offers.

Added Account Properties UI.

Account Control UI improvements and bugfixes.

This release will do a blockchain rescan on testnet only, deleting blocks
after height 484310.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.7.1e:

This is an experimental bugfix release. It is a mandatory update for testnet
nodes.

Added nxt.useStrongSecureRandom property, default false, to control whether a
strong SecureRandom implementation is used.

Test speed of SecureRandom on startup and refuse to start if slower than 512
bytes per second.

Disallow starting multiple shufflers for the same recipient account on the same
node, even if for different shufflings.

Fixed local signing of shuffling create transactions for holdings.

Added current registrant count to shuffling fields.

Improved handling of failed transactions submitted by shufflers.

Improved My Shufflers, My Shufflings, and Active Shufflings UI.

GetHoldingShufflings should return shufflings of NXT if holding parameter is
not specified or zero.

Blacklist peer versions older than 1.7 on testnet.

This release will do a blockchain rescan on testnet only.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.7.0e:

This is an experimental release. The new features will be activated at block
483000 on testnet (Nov 30) and 621000 on production (estimated Jan 21, 2016).

All testnet nodes are required to upgrade to this release. Those that don't
will remain on a fork.

Production nodes will need to upgrade to the stable 1.7 version once it is
released (expected before end of December), but in any case before the
hardfork scheduled for block 621000.


New features:

Coin Shuffling. This feature is based on the paper by Tim Ruffing et al,
http://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/coinshuffle.pdf .

Coin shuffling can be used to perform mixing of NXT, MS currencies (unless
created as non-shuffleable), or AE assets. Any account can create a new
shuffling, specifying the holding to be shuffled, the shuffle amount, number
of participants required, and registration deadline. This is done using the
shufflingCreate API. The subsequent shuffling steps can be done either
manually, by using the shufflingRegister (for accounts other than the
creator), shufflingProcess, shufflingVerify or shufflingCancel APIs, or, much
more conveniently, by starting an automated Shuffler, using the startShuffler
API. Once started, the Shuffler monitors the blockchain state for transactions
relevant to the specified shuffle, and automatically submits the required
transactions on behalf of the user, performing shuffle processing,
verification, or cancellation as needed. To do this, the Shuffler is required
to keep the user secret phrase in memory, therefore it should be run on a
trusted local machine only. A restart or a crash of the node requires the
shuffler to be started again using the startShuffler API, as it should never
save the user secret phrase on disk.

To participate in a shuffling, a deposit of 1000 NXT is needed, in addition
to the amount of currency or asset being shuffled. Or if shuffling NXT, the
amount of the shuffle must exceed this 1000 NXT minimum. If the shuffling
completes successfully, this amount is added to the recipient account balance,
to allow it to send outgoing transactions (as it is required that only new,
unused accounts are specified as recipients). If the shuffle fails due to
a registered participant failing to participate as required, or intentionally
submitting false data, the participant responsible for the shuffle
cancellation is penalized by retaining this deposit and sending it to the
forgers of the shuffle finish block and the previous three blocks instead.
If a shuffle is cancelled because the required number of participants is not
met, nobody is penalized and all deposits are refunded. On testnet, the deposit
and penalty is 7 NXT only.

After shuffling registration is complete, participants must submit processing
data within a 100 blocks period each (10 blocks on testnet). For the
verification and blame phase, the total allowance for all participants is 100
+ numberOfParticipants blocks (again reduced to 10 + n blocks on testnet).
Full blocks are not counted towards the limit. If at any stage the deadline is
reached without some participant submitting the next required transaction, the
shuffling is cancelled at this participant's fault. It is therefore critical
that after registering for a shuffling, the shuffler started is left running
until its successful completion. If the node must be restarted, all previously
running shufflers must be started again manually.

Query APIs to retrieve currently running shufflers, shufflings, and shuffling
participants are: getAllShufflings, getAccountShufflings,
getAssignedShufflings, getHoldingShufflings, getShufflers, getShuffling, and
getShufflingParticipants.

If desired, finished shufflings can be automatically deleted from the database
if the nxt.deleteFinishedShufflings property is set to true (default is false).

The fee for creating a shuffling or registering in one is 1 NXT, for the
shuffling process or shuffling cancel transactions 10 NXT, and for the verify
transaction 1 NXT.


Account control for phased transactions. Any account can be restricted to only
be allowed to issue phased transactions subject to a specific voting model.
This is achieved by the account submitting a setPhasingOnly transaction using
the setPhasingOnlyControl API. The getPhasingOnlyControl API can be used to
retrieve the status of an account phasing control, and
getAllPhasingOnlyControls to get all accounts subject to phasing control with
their respective restrictions.

Once set, the phasing only account control can only be disabled or changed
with another setPhasingOnly transaction, itself subject to the currently set
phasing restrictions.

Note that by-transaction and by-hash voting models are not allowed for phasing
control, and setting voting model to none is used to disable the control.

To prevent deadlocks due to cyclic account control restrictions, approval
transactions themselves (PhasingVoteCasting) are not subject to phasing only
account control.

When setting phasing account control, a maximum fees total can be specified,
limiting the total fees for currently pending phased transactions of the
controlled account, and limits can be placed on minimum and maximum phasing
duration allowed.

Transactions of accounts subject to phasing account control with restriction
on maximum fees are throttled at one per account per block.


Immediate release of phased transactions on approval. Phased transactions with
a voting model that does not depend on account balance (such as by-transaction
or by-hash), or by-account with no minimum balance and with a whitelist, will
be released before their finish height as soon as approved (in the block in
which the transaction causing their approval is executed), if possible. Such
early finish is guaranteed for transaction types known to be phasing safe. For
others, if the early finish does not succeed due to the transaction failing
validation at this height or conflicting with another transaction in the same
block, a second, final release attempt will be performed at finish height.


New base target adjustment algorithm. Average block times will be 60 s, with
1440 blocks per day. Block times should practically never exceed 10 min.

Limit of 1000 NXT on minimum forging balance. This applies to the total of the
account own guaranteed balance plus any balances leased to it, but not to each
individual balance lease. An account with balance lower than the limit can
still lease its balance to another.


Account properties. Those are name / value pairs that can be set on any
account (except Genesis), by either the account owner, or by another account.
Names are limited to 32 characters, and values to 160 characters. Names are
unique per account and per setter account, but not globally unique. Account
properties cannot be transferred between accounts. The setter of an account
property can edit it by replacing its value with another. Either the setter,
or the recipient (if different) of an account property can delete it. There
is no limit on the number of properties an account can have. Fee for setting
account property is 1 NXT for value up to 32 chars, with additional 1 NXT fee
for every 32 chars after that.

Account properties are managed using the setAccountProperty and
deleteAccountProperty APIs. To query the properties of an account, or those
set by an account, the getAccountProperties API can be used.


Singleton assets. Issuing an asset with a quantity of 1, decimals 0, and
description length not exceeding 160 characters, will require a base minimum
fee of 1 NXT only, instead of the regular 1000 NXT asset issuance fee. For
description of more than 32 chars, an extra 1 NXT fee is added for each 32
chars. Asset name for singleton assets is limited to 10 chars, same as for
regular assets.

Throttling of unique resource allocation transactions. Asset issuance
(excluding singleton assets), monetary system currency issuance, and alias
assignment (excluding re-assignment), will be limited to only one transaction
of each type accepted per block.


Spreading back block fees for asset and currency issuance. The transaction
fees for asset (excluding singleton assets) and currency issuance will be
split between the forgers of the current and the previous three blocks in a
4:3:2:1 ratio.


Prunable plain and prunable encrypted message attachments both allowed in the
same transaction. The maximum data size for each such attachment is 42 kbytes,
but when coexisting in the same transaction the sum of the two is still being
limited by the maximum payload size of 44880 bytes.


Peers that provide http or https API access open to anyone, configured with
nxt.apiServerHost=0.0.0.0 and nxt.allowedBotHosts=* , are now labelled as
providing a service, API or API_SSL, and can be found using the getPeers API
with the corresponding "service" parameter. This API has been modified to
accept multivalued "service" parameter, returning peers that match all
requested services. The ports on which the open API access is running are
included in the peer info of peers providing those services as apiPort and
apiSSLPort fields.


Incompatible changes:

Deletion of asset shares will be performed as a separate AssetDelete
transaction type instead of as sending the shares to Genesis. Sending shares
to Genesis will no longer be allowed. A new API, getAssetDeletes has been
added to retrieve asset deletions, as using the getAssetTransfers API to find
transfers to Genesis account no longer can be used for that purpose. There is
also a new API, getExpectedAssetDeletes, to get asset deletes expected in the
next block, analogous to getExpectedAssetTransfers.

Since both prunable plain and prunable encrypted messages can now be added to
the same transaction, the APIs getAllPrunableMessages, getPrunableMessage, and
getPrunableMessages cannot continue to use just a single "isText" boolean field
in the JSON response to indicate if the prunable message is text or binary.
For all prunable plain messages, a new "messageIsText" boolean field is added,
and for all prunable encrypted messages, a new "encryptedMessageIsText" boolean
field is added in the response of the above APIs, for each message.
For backwards compatibility, the "isText" field will continue to be added, but
only for transactions that have either plain, or encrypted, prunable message
attachment, not for those that have both.
This change does not affect the attachment JSON returned from getTransaction
API, as there are already separate messageIsText and encryptedMessage.isText
fields there.


Fees and size limit changes. Several transaction types or attachments will
have new fees and size limits, to encourage users to utilize the prunable
versions when available, and to make fees proportionate to actual blockchain
space consumed.

Aliases:
Base fee 2 NXT, with 2 NXT additional fee for each 32 chars of name plus URI
total length, after the first 32 chars. Name and URI size limits remain at
100 and 1000 chars respectively.

Messages and EncryptedMessages (non-prunable):
Maximum length reduced to 160 bytes. 1 NXT fee for each 32 bytes after the
first 32 bytes. For encrypted messages, the length is measured excluding the
nonce and the 16 byte AES initialization vector, and to account for those
there is an extra fee of 1 NXT.
Fees and size limit for prunable messages remain unchanged.

AccountInfo:
Base fee 1 NXT, with 2 NXT additional fee for each 32 chars of name plus
description total length, after the first 32 chars. Name and description size
limits remain at 100 and 1000 chars. AccountInfo transactions throttled at
one per block.

Polls:
Base fee 10 NXT for polls with up to 20 options, and total size of poll name
plus poll description plus total option length not exceeding 320 chars. For
each option above 20, an additional fee of 1 NXT, and for each 32 chars after
320, an additional fee of 2 NXT. Poll creation throttled to one per block.
Name, description, and option length limits remain at 100, 1000, and 100 chars
respectively.

DGS Listing:
Base fee 2 NXT, with 2 NXT additional fee for each 32 chars of name plus
description total length, after the first 32 chars. Name and description size
limits remain at 100 and 1000 max. DGS Listing throttled at one per block.

DGS Delivery:
Base fee 1 NXT, with 2 NXT additional fee for each 32 bytes of encrypted goods
data after the first 32 bytes, nonce and AES initialization bytes excluded.
Encrypted goods data size limit remains 1000 bytes.

Phasing:
In addition to the current fee for phasing (1 NXT for balance independent,
20 NXT otherwise), 1 NXT will be added for each 32 bytes of hashedSecret or
linkedFullHash fields.

Referenced transactions:
An extra fee of 1 NXT for the 32 byte referencedTransactionFullHash if set,
i.e. if the transaction is using the referenced transactions feature.


To facilitate migration of legacy client code to the new fees, if the property
nxt.correctInvalidFees=true has been set in nxt.properties (default is false),
the server will automatically replace insufficient fees for submitted unsigned
transactions with the minimum fee needed, depending on the transaction, as if
feeNQT=0 has been specified. Fees exceeding the minimum, or fees for already
signed transactions, will not be corrected.

This release will perform a blockchain rescan on first start.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.6.2:

The 1.6 series is no longer considered experimental. If upgrading from 1.5.15
or earlier, see the 1.6.0e and 1.6.1e changelogs for other important changes
in 1.6.

The account ledger now uses transaction id as event id for all events except
block generation. To apply this change, the account ledger table will be
automatically truncated on upgrade to this release. Users who desire to
restore the deleted past account ledger entries should run a full rescan from
the API test page. Note that account ledger records are only kept for 30000
blocks by default.

Added currency transfers history page to the Monetary System UI.

Added generate hallmark dialog to facilitate hallmarking your node. The host
field is pre-populated with the external node address as detected by UPnP.
Note that when using dynamic IP address you should set up and use a dynamic
DNS hostname instead of the numeric IP for the hallmark. And when using a
non-default port, the host field should be filled as host:port.

Added "clear results" link in the ShapeShift My Exchanges section, to allow
clearing past transaction history. As this history data is being retrieved
from the ShapeShift servers, it allows correlating Nxt accounts previously
used for exchange transactions with the current user IP address and with each
other, thus clearing history after no longer needed is important for the user
privacy.

Funding a new account using ShapeShift now relies on the ShapeShift sendamount 
API which provides better conversion rate. The user first specifies the 
amount of NXT to receive, the dialog then presents a deposit address for the 
source currency which the user needs to fund with the exact amount within 10 
minutes.

Added ledger tab to the account info dialog.

Added includeAssetInfo or includeCurrencyInfo parameters, default false, to
the getAccountAssets, getAccountCurrencies, getAccountExchangeRequests,
getExpectedAssetTransfers, and getExpectedCurrencyTransfers APIs.

Tabs are now sorted mostly alphabetically on the API test page.

Added nxt.hideErrorDetails property, default false, to allow suppressing node
specific configuration details in error messages returned to peers.

Increased default prunable lifetime setting to 90 days. Minimum enforced is
still 2 weeks.

The UPnP connection timeouts are now also configurable in nxt.properties.

Updated Bouncy Castle library to version 1.53, Jetty to version 9.3.5, IzPack
installer to 5.0.5, and weupnp to 0.1.4. Make sure to delete the old lib
folder if unpacking over a previous installation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.6.1e:

This is an experimental release.

New feature: ShapeShift exchange integration.

The ShapeShift plugin is now integrated in the core NRS package. A detailed
description of this in-client coin exchange functionality is available at:

https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issues/316/shapeshift-integration


This release also adds several API changes and optimizations.

Added getExpectedTransactions API, to return the non-phased unconfirmed
transactions expected to be included in the next block (only), plus the phased
transactions scheduled to finish in that block (whether approved or not).
Takes an optional multivalued "account" parameter, to filter the result by
transaction sender or recipient account.

The "account" parameter of getUnconfirmedTransactions and
getUnconfirmedTransactionIds APIs can also be repeated multiple times now, to
specify more than one account.

Several APIs have been enhanced to make dealing with phased transactions
easier.

getBlock and getBlocks now take an optional includeExecutedPhased boolean
parameter, default false. If true, the phased transactions approved and
executed in each block (which were accepted in some previous block), if any,
are included separately in the response, as either an array of transaction ids
or full transaction json depending on the value of the includeTransactions
parameter.

getTransaction and getBlockchainTransactions now take an optional boolean
parameter includePhasingResult, default false. If true, the execution status
of each phased transaction is also retrieved and included in the result.
The status of each phased transaction is retrieved in a separate database
query, so for getBlockchainTransactions requests that retrieve many phased
transactions at the same time the performance of this API may not be optimal.

getBlockchainTransactions now takes an optional executedOnly boolean
parameter, default false. If true, phased transactions that were not executed
are not included in the result.


Incompatible changes:

As a performance optimization, many query APIs that accept an object id as
parameter, i.e. account, asset, currency, and so on, now no longer load this
object from the database if only having the id is sufficient to retrieve the
required records. This has the side effect that such APIs now will return an
empty result list instead of an error when supplied with a non-existent object
id. Missing or malformed id parameters will still return an error as expected.

For example, getAssetAccounts will now return an empty shareholder list
instead of unknown asset error, when supplied with a non-existent asset id.

This change affects the query APIs only, not the create transaction APIs.

As another performance optimization, for all APIs that accept optional
"include" parameters to retrieve additional data, e.g. includeCounts,
includeAssetInfo, includeCurrencyInfo, and so on, the default value of those
parameters (i.e. when not explicitly specified) is now assumed to be false.
API users will have to set those parameters to true when these extra data
are really needed. One important API affected by this change is getAccount,
for which now includeLessors, includeAssets, includeCurrencies,
includeEffectiveBalance are all assumed to be false if not specified, i.e.
only the account NXT balance and info are returned by default.

As announced with the 1.6.0e release, upgrade to the 1.6 branch is optional,
users who depend on the current 1.5 API behavior can stay with 1.5 up until
the 1.7 hard fork.


The default search query operator, used when searching the MS currencies or
the marketplace, is now AND instead of OR.

The Lucene full text search library has been updated to version 5.3.1, and
Jetty has been updated to version 9.3.3. Remove the old lib subdirectory if
unpacking on top of a previous installation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.6.0e:

This experimental release adds several major new features. It does not require
a hard fork, and update to the 1.6 branch will be completely optional even
after it is declared stable. 1.6 peers are compatible with 1.5 peers, but as
usual the database changes are not reversible, going back from 1.6 to 1.5
would require starting again from a 1.5 database.


Account ledger:

The account ledger feature provides a record of all recent changes to the
account balances (including NXT, asset, and currency balances), and the event
that caused each change. It is enabled by default for all account, but can be
set to track certain accounts only or be disabled completely, using the
nxt.ledgerAccounts property. By default records are kept for the last 30,000
blocks, this can be changed using the nxt.ledgerTrimKeep property.
The nxt.ledgerLogUnconfirmed property controls whether confirmed, unconfirmed,
or both types of changes are tracked.

The new APIs getAccountLedger and getAccountLedgerEntry are used to retrieve
account ledger records. Their parameters and response fields are documented in
the javadoc.

Account ledger events can also be followed using the existing eventRegister
and eventWait API.

Using account ledger events as an alternative to the getAccountTransactions or
getBlockchainTransactions API completely avoids the need to handle phased
transactions as a special case. Only changes to account balances that actually
happened, and at the time (block height) they happened, are recorded in the
account ledger. The account ledger also makes it easier to monitor an account
for changes that occurred as a result of past transactions (e.g. an AE order
being filled), or are result of dividend payment transactions, or block
forging fees.


Peer services:

Peers can advertise to other peers the set of services they provide, and
include this information when sharing peer addresses with each other. Currently
available services are Hallmark (being a hallmarked peer), and Prunable
(providing archival and retrieval service for expired prunable data).

To configure a peer to provide the Prunable service, nxt.maxPrunableLifetime
must be set to -1 and nxt.includeExpiredPrunable must be true (default). Such
a peer will then provide expired prunable data to other peers when requested.
If nxt.includeExpiredPrunable is false, the node will still keep prunable data
indefinitely (if nxt.maxPrunableLifetime is -1), but will not provide them to
others.

The services a peer provides are also exposed in the getBlockchainStatus and
getStatus APIs. The getPeers API accepts optional service parameter, to
filter the result based on desired provided service, and includes the services
each peer provides in the peer info.


Restore prunable data:

A peer configured with nxt.maxPrunableLifetime=-1, or any positive value
higher than the minimum of two weeks (1209600 seconds), when downloading the
blockchain from scratch, will automatically start requesting the missing
prunable parts (prunable plain/encrypted messages, and tagged data) from any
archival peers it finds on the network (those providing the Prunable service).

This task of requesting and restoring missing prunable data can also be
triggered using the new retrievePrunedDat debug API, for peers that already
have the full blockchain or need to be restarted during the download process.

(Note that when nxt.maxPrunableLifetime is set to a positive value, extend
tagged data transactions are ignored for the purpose of selecting which
pruned tagged data to retrieve, the timestamp on the original upload data
transaction is what is being used. To make sure all pruned data are retrieved,
set nxt.maxPrunableLifetime to -1, and if really needed set it back to the
desired value after the initial restore is complete.)

The getBlockchainTransactions API now accepts optional includeExpiredPrunable
parameter, to force including expired prunable parts in the response, if
available (default false).


Asset delete:

Asset transfers to the Genesis accounts are now treated as deleting the
corresponding number of shares, with the total asset quantity adjusted
accordingly. A new deleteAssetShares API has been added to perform this
function. At the next hard fork (1.7), asset transfers to Genesis will be
completely disallowed and the deleteAssetShares API will then create a new
AssetDelete transaction type, to achieve the same quantity reduction effect.


API additions:

A new getTaggedDataExtendTransactions API has been added, to retrieve all
tagged data extend transactions for a given tagged data upload transaction.

The getConstants API now also returns a list of all supported request types
and their properties.

The approveTransaction API accepts revealedSecretIsText boolean parameter,
default false, as a way of specifying whether revealedSecret is text or
binary. The old revealedSecretText parameter to submit the text value
directly is still supported.

Added encodeQRCode and decodeQRCode APIs, to handle the encoding and decoding
of QR image on the server side, instead of in javascript, using the ZXing java
QR processing library, version 3.2.1. This improves the generation and parsing
of QR codes used in offline transaction processing, images that failed to
decode correctly using javascript can now successfully be processed.

Allow attaching encrypted messages to accounts that don't yet have a public
key announced, as long as the public key is included in the same transaction
as a public key announcement attachment.


Several performance optimizations have been included in this release:

The last 10 blocks and the transactions in them are now cached in memory.
The unconfirmed transactions (up to nxt.maxUnconfirmedTransactions, default
2000) are also cached in memory.

Accounts with zero balance are now deleted from the account table, which
significantly reduces its size and should make queries for the balances of the
active accounts faster. Only public keys for such accounts, if available, are
permanently stored in the separate public_key table. Creation of new accounts
for one-time use, which is the practice of many exchanges and merchants,
should now be less of a burden for the database, as long as such accounts are
fully emptied after use.


Updated jetty to version 9.3.2. If unpacking on top of a previous installation,
delete the old lib subdirectory first.

This release will perform a database upgrade and rescan on first start.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.15:

Full offline transaction signing support.

The purpose of this security feature is to allow users to sign transactions
without ever entering their passphrase on a workstation connected to the
internet, thus avoiding the risk of having their passphrase stolen by locally
installed malware such as key loggers or copy/paste loggers, or malicious
plugins.

As a prerequisite to using this feature, users should setup two workstations:

(1) online with up to date blockchain, on which transactions will be prepared;

(2) offline with Java and NXT installed, but without internet connection, and
without needing to have up to date blockchain, on which transactions will be
signed.

The nxt.isOffline=true parameter can be used on the offline machine to make
sure it doesn't even try to connect to peers or to listen on the peer port.

In addition, users should prepare either a web camera to scan QR codes, or a
USB stick to copy data between the workstations.

The following procedure should be followed:

On the online workstation - users can create a transaction without entering
their passphrase. Click on the "advanced" link, check the "Do Not Broadcast"
option, and then check the newly added "Do Not Sign" option that appears.
When "Do Not Sign" is checked, the passphrase field is cleared and disabled.

If the account submitting the transaction does not yet have its public key
announced, a separate input field appears, to allow entering the public key.

In response, the server returns the unsigned transaction JSON, and in case
there are no message attachments to be encrypted, also the unsigned
transaction bytes.

The client now displays the "Raw Transaction Details" modal with the unsigned
transaction JSON, and the unsigned transaction bytes (including a QR code
representing them), if those exist.

The unsigned transaction bytes do not include the prunable attachments,
however they can still be used for signing the transaction, and also for
broadcasting the transaction in case no prunable attachments exist.

Users can transfer the unsigned transaction bytes to the offline workstation
by scanning the QR code, or download the unsigned transaction JSON to a file
by clicking the download icon, and transfer it using a USB stick to the
offline workstation.

On the offline workstation - users should use the "Transaction Operations"
modal, "Sign Transaction" tab, to sign the unsigned transaction JSON, which
can be uploaded from a file.

In response, a signature field is displayed, with a QR code, and also the
signed transaction JSON which users can save to a file for transferring back
to the online workstation.

Back on the online workstation, users can scan the signature QR code into the
"Raw Transaction Details" modal signature field, and broadcast the
transaction. Alternatively, they can use the "Broadcast Transaction" tab of
the "Transaction Operations" modal to broadcast the transaction JSON copied
from the offline workstation.

A command line tool, sign.sh, has been provided, for signing transaction JSON
without needing to even have an Nxt server or a browser running.

Note that when the transaction to be signed includes a message to be encrypted,
the encryption is also performed on the offline workstation. However, when
generating the unsigned transaction JSON on the online workstation, if using
a remote node, the plain text content of the message must be sent to this node
in order for it to prepare the transaction JSON. Therefore, use a local
installation when preparing encrypted messages for offline signing, if the
content of the message is sensitive.

All tabs in the "Transaction Operations" modal that have both bytes and json
input fields need to have only one of them filled. If in doubt, using the json
is preferred, as it will work for all transactions. The bytes format is still
accepted, when possible, for backwards compatibility, and for transferring
using QR codes (as the json cannot fit in a QR representation).


Other changes:

The signTransaction API now also returns the full signed transaction JSON.

The calculateFullHash API now also accepts unsignedTransactionJSON parameter.

Added getLastTrades and getLastExchanges API, accepting a multivalue asset,
respectively currencies parameter, and returning an array containing the last
trade or exchange for each of those assets or currencies.

Added fullHashToId utility API.

Display warning when trying to issue an asset or currency with less than 2
or more than 6 decimals.

Display total value of currencies owned on dashboard. Set default leasing
period to the maximum allowed (32767) in the UI. Other UI improvements.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.13. If unpacking on top of existing installation,
delete the lib subdirectory first.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.14:

Using cached thread pool for blockchain download and event listeners threads,
resulting in better parallelism and faster blockchain download speeds.

The getAskOrders and getBidOrders APIs now accept an optional boolean
parameter showExpectedCancellations, default false, to show if any of the
orders returned are expected to be cancelled in the next block, based on the
content of the unconfirmed transactions pool and the phased transactions
expected to finish in the next block.

Expected order cancellations are now shown in the asset exchange UI.

The calculate hash modal can now be used for all supported hash algorithms.

Fixed handling of non-ascii characters in the filename for the
DownloadTaggedData API.

Fixed incorrect fees shown in the client for some phased transaction types.
Fixed missing approval button for phased transactions.

Load html page and modal before javascript for plugins.

Updated some translation files, added Turkish as experimental, status of
Catalan and Romanian translations changed to stable.

Updated jetty libraries to version 9.2.12. If unpacking on top of a previous
installation, delete the old lib directory first.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.13:

Fixed Token validation to check whether the public key matches the one
announced in the blockchain for the same account.

Added compact.sh/compact.bat scripts to compact the database, resulting in
smaller size and possibly better performance. Those should only be run when
the Nxt server is not running.

API improvements:

getAllPrunableMessages, getAssetTransfers, getBlocks, getCurrencyTransfers,
getPolls, getPrunableMessages now allow filtering by block timestamp.

Many APIs now support requireBlock and requireLastBlock optional parameters.
If either of those is specified, it is guaranteed that the specified block is
present in the blockchain, or the specified last block is the current last
block, and the blockchain state does not change, while the API request is
being executed. An error is returned otherwise.

Added getExpectedAskOrders, getExpectedBidOrders, getExpectedAssetTransfers,
getExpectedBuyOffers, getExpectedSellOffers, getExpectedCurrencyTransfers,
getExpectedExchangeRequests, getExpectedOrderCancellations.
Those return the corresponding orders, transfers, or offers, that are expected
to be executed in the next blocks, based on the current content of the
unconfirmed transactions pool, and the phased transactions planned to finish
in the next block, in the order in which they are expected to be executed.
It is not guaranteed that the next block will indeed contain exactly those
transactions and in the same order, as this is up to the block forger.
It is also not possible to know in advance if the phased transactions expected
to finish in the next block will be approved or rejected.

getAccountExchangeRequests now excludes the phased exchange requests that have
not yet finished, or have not been approved, and the timestamp field now
contains the block timestamp of the block in which the exchange request was
executed, rather than the transaction timestamp.

getPollVotes and getPollVote now accept includeWeights parameter, default
false, to calculate and display the weight assigned to each vote in the poll
results.

Added Hash API, for calculating the hash of a secret using any of the
supported hash functions, which can be used for deriving the hash in by-hash
phasing. See getConstants for the list of supported hash functions.

For running over tor, or other socks proxy, the socksProxyHost and
socksProxyPort parameters can now be specified in the nxt.properties file
instead of having to include them in the command line.

Performance improvements, allowing table trimming to be done in parallel with
blockchain download.

Added UPnP support, enabled by default for the peer port and disabled for the
API port, using the nxt.enablePeerUPnP and nxt.enableAPIUPnP properties.

Added a warning on startup if nxt.myAddress is set but does not resolve to any
of the external addresses found, including those discovered using UPnP.

More links to the wiki tutorials in the help menu.

System tray status dialog now refreshes every second when visible.

Client UI:

The asset exchange page now displays unconfirmed orders as well as phased
orders that are expected to be executed in the next block.

The monetary system page now displays unconfirmed exchange requests and offers
as well as phased requests and offers that are expected to be executed in the
next block.

Phasing modals "None", "By Transaction" and "By Hash" were implemented as part
of the advanced section of transaction modals.

Calculate hash modal is now available in the settings menu. Use it to calculate
hash values for "By Hash" phasing model.

Added "Admin Password" field to the client settings. Set it to the server admin
password to allow the client to automatically determine its forging status when
connected to a remote node.

Peer modal dialogs now use the admin password specified in the client settings
as default value.

Forging indicator is displayed in Gray instead of Red when the forging status
cannot be determined by the client when connecting to a remote node without
specifying a correct admin password.

Forging indicator tooltip, now displays further information about the forging
status.

Transaction info dialog correctly follows links between matching bid and ask
orders and links from vote to poll.

Marketplace usage warning and a corresponding, marketplace enablement
setting has been implemented.

This release will perform a rescan on first start.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.12:

Significantly reduced the number of threads used when WebSockets are enabled.
This should prevent the out of memory issues on some systems caused by
excessive number of native threads created.

Fixed important bugs in fork resolution during blockchain download.

Improved blockchain download speeds, reduce load on hallmarked nodes and avoid
slow peers during download.

Send event notifications when using the eventRegister and eventWait APIs only
after the database transaction has been committed, to make sure the changes
that triggered the event are visible at the time the event is emitted.

Added generateFileToken and decodeFileToken APIs, allowing creating and
verifying tokens for files.

Fixed file upload when using the test page.

The maximum file size accepted for upload can be restricted using the new
nxt.maxUploadFileSize property, default and minimum accepted value is 42 kB.


Client UI:

Fixed missing scrollbars in modals invoked from other modals.

Updated some translations. Added Romanian translation (experimental).

Updated bootstrap to version 3.3.4.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.11:

This release removes compatibility with peers older than version 1.5, and no
longer accepts connections from them.

Conditional logic dependent on block 445000 has been removed where no longer
necessary, as block 445000 has been passed now.

Parallel blockchain download using 36-block segments is now the default
regardless of height. Returning more than 36 blocks at a time by getNextBlocks
is no longer supported.

The maximum WebSockets message size and the maximum allowed response size to a
getNextBlocks request have been reduced from 192 MB to 10 MB.

A checksum at block 445000 has been added.

Added isDownload field to the getBlockchainStatus and getState API response,
indicating if blockchain download is in progress. This gets set to true when
a batch of more than 10 blocks at once has been downloaded from a peer, and
gets reset to false when an attempt to download more blocks from a peer does
not result in any new blocks added.

The peer requests getUnconfirmedTransactions, getMilestoneBlockIds,
getNextBlockIds, getNextBlocks, processBlock, processTransactions,
getCumulativeDifficulty, are being rejected while a blockchain download is in
progress, as indicated by the above isDownloading property.

The timestamp of the last connect attempt to a peer is now included in the peer
JSON object.

Added a connect parameter to DumpPeers debug API, to force a connection attempt
to each known peer first, adminPassword required if needed.

The run.bat script on Windows no longer uses the -server flag by default.

Updating nodes of version older than 1.5 to this release will delete blocks
after height 445000, to make sure such nodes are not left permanently stranded
on the 1.4 fork.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.10:

Create installer package for Windows and Linux using the IzPack installer.
See https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issue/283

Added separate linux and windows (cygwin) build and release scripts.

Track and log database query execution times. The new properties:
nxt.statementLogThreshold, nxt.transactionLogThreshold, and
nxt.transactionLogInterval can be used to configure logging of slow queries.

Database performance improvements and optimizations. The account leasing data
has been moved from the account table to a separate account_lease table.
More table indexes have been added or existing ones modified.

Improved JSON encoding performance.

Outbound websockets connections are no longer initiated when using a socks or
http proxy (if system property socksProxyHost or http.proxyHost is defined).

Include expired prunable JSON in API transaction JSON, if available.

To protect public nodes from unneeded extra load, the getState API does not
include counts even if includeCounts=true, unless the adminPassword is either
provided as a parameter, or is not needed.

Added numberOfAccountLeases and numberOfActiveAccountLeases to getState,
showing the total number of scheduled (first lease only) or currently active
account balance leases.

Limit peer details length to 10 characters for version, 20 for application,
30 for platform, and 100 for announced address.


Client UI improvements:

Fixed a bug sometimes not showing notification badge after login.

Improved Bulgarian and Slovak translations.

Fix local signing of upload tagged data and approve transaction

This release will perform a full blockchain rescan on first start.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.11. If unpacking on top of existing installation,
delete the old lib folder first.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.9:

Enable Voting System, Phasing, and related new features at block 445000.

This is a hard fork, upgrade to 1.5.9 or later is mandatory for everyone.

If upgrading from 1.4.x, read the 1.5.0e and later changelogs for the
important changes and new features introduced in the 1.5 series.

Peer networking improvements. Peers unreachable for more than 7 days and not
listed under nxt.wellKnownPeers or nxt.defaultPeers are removed from the peers
database.

Updated some translation files, added Bulgarian and Catalan translations.

Other minor bugfixes and improvements.


Important licensing change:

The Nxt core software is now distributed under the GNU General Public License
version 2, with the exception of the client UI code which remains under the
MIT license. Please read the files LICENSE.txt, COPYING.txt and
DEVELOPER-AGREEMENT.txt for more information.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.8e:

This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Set the content type to "text/plain; charset=UTF-8" when sending http requests
to peers. This is an important bug fix, as the incorrect encoding of outgoing
blocks and transactions containing some Unicode characters can prevent their
propagation and lead to forks. Everyone running the experimental release should
update.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.7e:

This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Added WebSockets support in the peer to peer networking. When connecting to
peers that do not support WebSockets, HTTP is still used. WebSockets can be
disabled by setting nxt.useWebSockets to false (default is enabled).

Implemented parallel blockchain download. After Constants.PHASING_BLOCK (not
yet set on main net), blocks and transactions data will be requested from
multiple peers in parallel, in batches of 36 blocks (when more than 36 blocks
need to be downloaded), instead of downloading up to 720 blocks from the
single blockchain feeder peer. This is expected to reduce the time for full
blockchain download, once most nodes upgrade to support the parallel download
protocol.

Added file upload using multipart form requests to the UploadTaggedData,
ExtendTaggedData and VerifyTaggedData APIs. Added upload file button to the
corresponding forms on the /test page.

Added DownloadTaggedData API, to download tagged data as a file.

Added optional includeData boolean parameter to all GetTaggedData APIs, default
true, to allow omitting the actual data from the result for saving bandwith,
since it can now be retrieved separately using the DownloadTaggedData API.

Improved search by tags. Improved validation of tagged data.

Added includeEffectiveBalance to getAccount and getBalance API, default true.
If false, effective balance and guaranteed balance are not included in the
response, which should improve performance for these APIs.

Added HexConvert utility API.

Improved GetConstants JSON to include an alternative transaction type JSON
representation.

Peers in the nxt.wellKnownPeers list are always kept connected, regardless of
the number of connected public peers or the total number of know peers.

Added GetInboundPeers API, to return all peers that have sent a request to this
peer in the last 30 min.

Added inbound, inboundWebSocket, and outboundWebSocket boolean fields to the
Peer JSON returned by the getPeer and getPeers APIs, to show the inbound status
of each peer and whether it has established an inbound or outbound websocket
connections to this node.

Limit the total number of inbound or outbound connections, using the properties
nxt.maxNumberOfInboundConnections and nxt.maxNumberOfOutboundConnections,
defaults 250 and 50 respectively. The nxt.maxNumberOfConnectedPublicPeers value
cannot exceed the nxt.maxNumberOfOutboundConnections value (if it does, it is
set to nxt.maxNumberOfOutboundConnections).

The getAccountTransactions and getAccountTransactionIds APIs have been
restricted to always return only the non-phased transactions. Those APIs have
also been deprecated and will be removed in 1.6. The getBlockchainTransactions
API should be used instead, which has the same behavior but returns both phased
and non-phased transactions (by default, unless either phasedOnly or
nonPhasedOnly parameters is specified).
Do not simply replace getAccountTransactions with getBlockchainTransactions in
your client code without an understanding of how phased transactions work and
without being prepared to handle them correctly.

Added links to the Wiki documentation for each API request from the /test page.
The links are autogenerated and thus work only for the wiki sections following
the same hash tag pattern, but most of them currently do.

The JavaScript NRS.sendRequest() function no longer accepts a callback function
as its second parameter. Instead, when sending a request with no data, specify
the value {} as the second parameter and the callback function as the third
parameter.

Client UI improvements:

Implemented client side signing of the tagged data transactions.

Added File Upload form, accessible from the settings menu. Allow extending a
tagged data transaction from the transaction info modal.

Integration of current status of client translations for new 1.5 features,
new "experimental" state for languages with translation status at 40-50%+,
added Czech, Greek, Hindi translations in experimental state, updated
translation state for other languages (Beta: 70-80%+, Stable: 90-95%+).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.6e:

This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Peer networking improvements.

Announced addresses are always verified to resolve back to the peer address and
not accepted if they don't. Old peer instances and old announced addresses are
removed when a peer with dynamic IP changes address.

If nxt.maxNumberOfKnownPeers (default 2000) is exceeded, the peers pool size is
reduced back to nxt.minNumberOfKnownPeers (default 1000), keeping the highest
hallmarked peers first.

Peers are only identified by IP address now, not by address and port. Multiple
nodes sharing the same IP address will be treated as one peer, with announced
address and port as of the most recent GetInfo request or response sent out of
or received from this address.

Incompatible change: If using non-default port, the hallmark must also include
that port, otherwise the hallmark is ignored.

Optimizations in unconfirmed transaction propagation. When forwarding newly
received unconfirmed transactions to peers, if their count exceeds 10, the
broadcast is done in multiple batches of 10. When requesting unconfirmed
transactions from a peer, the ids of the transactions currently in the pool
are included in the request, so that the remote node does not need to include
them in the response. The response size is also limited to 100 transactions,
unless the requesting node does not provide such exclude parameter.

Each tagged data can now also have a channel field. The searchTaggedData API
can filter the search results by channel, and a new getChannelTaggedData API
has been added to retrieve tagged data by channel, optionally filtered by
account too.

Fixed the UI for AddPeer and BlacklistPeer to accept admin password if needed.

"Approve Transaction" action is now available in the transaction info actions
tab.

"Reveal Secret" field is added to the "Approve Transaction" modal when voting
model is "By Hash".

Enhanced the /test page to accept and pre-fill the test forms with any parameter
values supplied in the url, e.g.:
http://localhost:7876/test?requestType=getBlocks&lastIndex=10
&includeTransactions=true


This release will perform a full rescan on test net.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.5e:

This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Fixed processing of unconfirmed ExtendTaggedData transactions.

AddPeer and BlacklistPeer APIs now require POST and admin password.

This release will perform a full rescan on testnet.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.4e:

This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Fixed a bug in parsing ExtendTaggedData transaction json which prevents such
transactions from propagating between peers.

Added permanent message option to most send transaction dialogs.

Other minor bugfixes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.3e:

This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

This update adds the Prunable Tagged Data feature, planned to be enabled at the
voting system block too.


Prunable tagged data are similar to prunable plain messages with no recipient,
but with additional searchable metadata fields added. This feature can be used
for decentralized and trustless distribution of small (up to 42k, including
the metadata) pieces of data, which are by default stored for two weeks only
(24h on testnet), but can optionally be stored longer or indefinitely by some
nodes, and can be verified against the blockchain even after their expiration.

Currently each tagged data can have the following fields, in addition to the
data itself: name (required), description, tags, type, isText, filename.

Name, description and tags are indexed and searchable using Lucene. All data
and metadata is prunable, after pruning only a single 32 byte hash remains.

Fee for either uploading or extending tagged data is based on the total data
size (including metadata), and is 1 NXT for up to 1k bytes, 0.1 NXT for each
1k above, up to the limit of 42k.


New APIs:

UploadTaggedData - create and broadcast new tagged data.

ExtendTaggedData - extend the expiration time of already uploaded tagged data.
If the data is still available, only the transaction id is needed. If not,
already pruned data can be resurrected by including (in addition to the
original transaction id) all of its fields too, i.e. name, description, etc.
Anyone can submit an extension, not only the original uploader. Each extend
transaction increases the expiration deadline by two weeks (24 h on testnet).
Extending an existing tagged data from another account does not change the
original submitter account id by which it is indexed and searchable.

VerifyTaggedData - used to verify expired tagged data downloaded from another
node, against the hash in the current blockchain.

SearchTaggedData - full text search on name, tags, and description, optionally
filtered by submitter account.

GetTaggedData - retrieve tagged data by transaction id.

GetAccountTaggedData - retrieve all tagged data submitted by a given account.

GetAllTaggedData - retrieve all existing tagged data.

GetDataTags - returns the distinct tags of all tagged data, with the number
of data having each tag.

GetDataTagsLike - prefix search of data tags.

GetDataTagCount - the total number of distinct tags.

All the Get* and Search* APIs above can only retrieve tagged data that has
not been pruned yet.

There is no client UI support for any of these APIs. It is expected that
specialized third party plugins will be developed for specific tagged data
use cases, depending on file type and target user group.

Currently the pruning of tagged data is controlled by the same configuration
properties that are used for prunable messages expiration.

Same as with prunable messages, when using broadcastTransaction API to submit
an already signed tagged data upload transaction, the prunable parts must be
in the prunableAttachmentJSON parameter in case transactionBytes parameter is
used. If submitting transactionJSON, it already has the prunable parts.


New debug APIs:

GetAllBroadcastedTransactions - if transaction rebroadcasting is enabled,
returns the unconfirmed transactions that have been broadcasted from this node
but have not yet been received back from a peer.

GetAllWaitingTransactions - returns the unconfirmed transactions that are
currently temporarily kept in memory during transaction processing.

RebroadcastUnconfirmedTransactions - if transaction rebroadcasting is enabled,
causes transactions currently in the unconfirmed pool to be broadcasted to
peers again, until received back.


Other changes and bugfixes:

Improved handling of invalid transactions during block generation. Fixed
validation of AE order cancellation transactions. Fixed a memory leak in
processing of unconfirmed transactions. Set the default limit on waiting
unconfirmed transactions nxt.maxUnconfirmedTransactions to 1000.

The DGS goods delivery data size will be limited to 1000 bytes after VS block.

Bugfixes in prunable messages processing.

Fixed phasing with whitelisted approval accounts.

On testnet, this release will perform a full rescan on first start with
rollback to height 263895.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.2e:

This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Added getAllPrunableMessages API, returning all currently available prunable
messages in reverse block timestamp order.

Added verifyPrunableMessage API, which can be used to verify that a prunable
message obtained from another node (a service provider) matches the hash found
in the blockchain, i.e. has not been tampered with.

Show maxPrunableLifetime setting in getState and getBlockchainStatus. Show
current number of prunable messages in getState.

Changing the nxt.maxPrunableLifetime property now also affects existing
prunable messages (next time pruning is run), as transaction timestamps instead
of expiration timestamps are now used.

Reverted DGS goods delivery maximum size to 10 kbytes, same as in 1.4. For
goods of a larger size, a prunable encrypted message should be included in the
delivery instead.

Removed core restriction on 28 byte minimum prunable message length, this will
be checked by the client UI only.

Added nxt.includeExpiredPrunables property, to be able to force to still
include the prunable parts in the returned transaction JSON, even if expired,
as long as they are still available. Can be used to force an archival node to
always return those, thus allowing another archival node that feeds from it to
also get all of them.

Limit the number of unconfirmed transactions that can be brought in memory to
nxt.maxUnconfirmedTransactions, no limit by default. If set, transactions with
lowest fee/size ratio are dropped from the unconfirmed pool first. The ordering
is same as the one used when selecting which transactions to include in a new
block.

Added requeueUnconfirmedTransactions debug API.

Added support for uncompressed non-prunable encrypted messages and encrypted
to self messages, as a new appendix version, to avoid the need to specify the
compression status as a request parameter when reading them.

Added setLogging API, to allow changing log levels without having to restart
the server.

Added eventRegister and eventWait APIs, to be used for registering listeners
and waiting for server events instead of polling.

Changed the parameters accepted by broadcastTransaction. The prunable parts
must be submitted either in the transactionJSON, or, if using transactionBytes,
in a new prunableAttachmentJSON parameter, which has the same format as the
transaction attachment json. The prunableAttachmentJSON is also returned by
the signTransaction and getTransactionBytes APIs now.

Added support for prunable plain and encrypted messages in the client UI.

Added optional buyer parameter to getDGSGoodsPurchases API.

Voting system UI improvements and bugfixes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.1e:

This is an experimental release which adds the Prunable Messages feature. It
will be enabled at the same block as the Voting and Phasing features.

This is a required update for all testnet nodes, but is also possible to run
on main net.


New features:

Prunable plain and encrypted messages.

Plain and encrypted messages can now be created as prunable. For a prunable
message, the message data itself is never a part of the transaction bytes.
Instead, only a 32 byte sha256 hash of it is included in the bytes that are
being signed, used to verify the signature, or to generate the full
transaction hash or id. This makes it possible to completely remove the
message data at a later time, keeping only that 32 byte hash, and still be
able to verify the transaction signature and have the transaction hash and
id unaffected by the pruning.

Prunable messages have a predefined lifetime, after which their prunable parts
are deleted from the blockchain. This lifetime is measured starting from the
transaction timestamp of the message. When a node receives a transaction or
a block from a peer, it is only required that the prunable parts of any
prunable message are also included if their expiration time has not yet been
reached. If it has, and a valid message hash is included instead, the block or
transaction will still be accepted.

Currently the minimum lifetime of all prunable data is set to 24 h for testnet,
to allow easier testing of this feature. For main net, it is tentatively set
to two weeks, but this is subject to change before the stable release. Note
that pruning is performed at the same time as derived table trimming, which
by default is every 1000 blocks, so the actual removal of the prunable data
from the database will happen with some delay after their expiration time.

A node can choose to keep prunable messages longer, by setting the
nxt.maxPrunableLifetime property to a larger value. It cannot be set to
prune them earlier. Changing this value only affect transactions received
after the change. Pruning can be disabled completely by setting this property
to -1.

Prunable messages that have not yet been expired, but are past the minimum
lifetime, are only retrievable using the getPrunableMessage(s) APIs, but
are not included as part of their transaction JSON.

If a transaction containing prunable attachments is phased, the prunable
parts are nevertheless saved and available immediately, not at finish height.
If their expiration deadline comes before the phasing finish height, they
will be pruned and not available at finish height.

Fees for prunable message attachments are set at 0.1 NXT per 1024 bytes, with
the first 1024 bytes free (the regular transaction fee depending on its type
still applies). This is again subject to change before the stable release.

The full size of prunable message attachments is limited to 42 kbytes. Note
that the full size is still included for the purpose of calculating the total
block payload, even though only the 32 byte hash is in the transaction bytes.

The size of regular plain and encrypted messages in this release has been
restricted back to 1000 bytes, and will likely be reduced even further, before
the stable release. This will be done in order to encourage users to switch to
prunable instead of regular messages. Fees for regular message attachments
will also be increased substantially.

Creating prunable plain messages of less than 28 bytes is not allowed, as at
such small sizes it is more efficient to store the full message instead of a
32 byte hash of it. There is no lower limit on prunable encrypted messages.

It is not possible for a transaction to have both prunable plain and prunable
encrypted message at the same time. It is also not possible to have both
prunable and regular message of the same type (plain or encrypted). It is
however possible to have a regular plain message and an encrypted prunable
message, or a prunable plain message and a regular encrypted message.

Prunable encrypt-to-self messages are not currently supported as there seems to
be no good use case for them.

Prunable encrypted messages can optionally be compressed before the encryption
(default is to compress). The compression status is stored and does not need to
be specified when decrypting. Regular encrypted messages are still compressed
by default, but this compression can now optionally be disabled. For backwards
compatibility, since their current bytes format does not store the compression
status, this needs to be specified again when decrypting, else an error or
unreadable data will be returned.


New APIs:

GetPrunableMessage - returns the prunable message for a given transaction id,
optionally decrypting it if encrypted and if a secretPhrase is supplied.

GetPrunableMessages - returns all prunable messages for a given account id,
optionally limiting to only those with another account as recipient or sender,
and decrypting them if a secretPhrase is supplied.

Prunable messages that have already been pruned are not returned by the above
APIs.

The UI for those APIs will be implemented in a later release.

TrimDerivedTables - a debug API to trigger a derived tables trim, and prunable
tables pruning.


Changed APIs:

All APIs that create a new transaction now also accept optional
messageIsPrunable or encryptedMessageIsPrunable boolean parameters (default
false). If true, the message or encrypted message attachment, if any, is
created as a prunable message.

To control whether compression is performed before the encryption or not,
the new compressMessageToEncrypt and compressMessageToEncryptToSelf parameters
can be used (default true).

Prunable messages, if not yet pruned, are also returned as part of the
transaction json by the getAccountTransactions API, using the same fields as
the corresponding regular messages, but adding a messageIsPrunable or
encryptedMessageIsPrunable boolean flag.

ReadMessage now also handles prunable message attachments, if any. It takes
an optional uncompressDecryptedMessage and uncompressDecryptedMessageToSelf
(default true) parameters, only used for non-prunable messages (not needed
for prunable ones).

DecryptFrom accepts an optional uncompressDecryptedMessage parameter, and
encryptTo accepts an optional compressMessageToEncrypt parameter, default true.


INCOMPATIBLE changes:

BroadcastTransaction has been modified to optionally accept all parameters that
are needed to create a prunable plain or encrypted message (client side
encryption only). This is required because the data for such messages is never
a part of the transaction bytes themselves, so trying to broadcast a transaction
that has a prunable part by only submitting its bytes to broadcastTransaction
WILL FAIL, unless the corresponding parameters necessary to add the prunable
parts are also supplied. Note that they need to exactly match the original
parameters with which the transaction bytes have been created and signed.

For non-prunable messages, broadcastTransaction behaves as before, but users
are encouraged to start switching to prunable messages in view of the planned
size restrictions and fee increases.

The EncryptedData java class no longer handles compression internally, this is
left to the caller of the encrypt and decrypt methods to do.


Other changes:

GetPolls now supports an optional includeFinished parameter (default false).

Multiple bugfixes and improvements in the Voting System and Phasing UI.

The limit on transaction deadline of 1440 minutes has been removed. It is now
possible to create a transaction with a deadline of up to 32767 minutes. This
has been done because many use cases of phasing require that the transaction
bytes are prepared much earlier than the actual broadcasting of the transaction
to the blockchain.

This release will perform a database upgrade with a full rescan on first start.
On testnet, it will cause a rollback to block 256935.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.5.0e:

This is an experimental release for the Voting System and Phasing. It enables
these features on testnet, and is a required update for all testnet nodes.

It is also possible to run this version on main net, but the block at which the
new features will be enabled has not been set yet.


New features:


Voting System.

Voting System API calls:

CreatePoll, CastVote, GetPoll, GetPolls, GetPollResult, GetPollVote,
GetPollVotes, SearchPolls.

Polls processing is optional. If nxt.processPolls=false (default is true), vote
counting is not done and no poll results are stored. This can be used to reduce
the load on lower performance nodes. It is still possible to get the results of
a poll using getPollResult, as long as the required vote and balances data
hasn't been trimmed yet.

Regardless of the nxt.processPolls setting, votes for polls that finished
before the last trim height (1441 blocks by default) are deleted and only
aggregate results, if processing is enabled, are kept.

Votes are weighted based on the voting model selected, which can be by account,
by balance, by asset balance or by currency balance, and a minimum balance
cutoff can also be specified. The voting model is defined when the poll is
created, however a different voting model can be specified when calling the
getPollResult API, to calculate on the fly an alternative vote counting, as
long as vote data is still available.

Voting multiple times, changing, or deleting votes is not allowed.

The fee to create a poll is 10 NXT for a poll with up to 20 options, with 1 NXT
additional fee for any additional option (max 100 options are possible).


Phasing.

Phasing API calls:

ApproveTransaction, GetAccountPhasedTransactions,
GetAccountPhasedTransactionCount, GetAssetPhasedTransactions,
GetCurrencyPhasedTransactions, GetPhasingPoll, GetPhasingPolls,
GetPhasingPollVote, GetPhasingPollVotes, GetVoterPhasedTransactions.

A transaction of any type can be phased by adding a phased=true parameter and
an appropriate set of phasing parameters. Phased transactions are accepted in
the blockchain immediately (subject to all usual validations), but are executed
only at finish height, if still valid and if the required quorum has been met.
If not approved, or not valid at finish height, they remain in the blockchain
but are never executed, and any changes they caused to the sender unconfirmed
balance are reversed, except that the fee is not refunded.

In addition to the voting models available in polls, phased transactions can
use a whitelist of accounts (max 10) allowed to vote for the transaction.

It is possible to vote for (approve) up to 10 phased transactions with a single
approval transaction. This transaction will be accepted in the blockchain only
if all phased transactions it is voting for are already in it.

Voting multiple times is allowed but has no effect on vote counting, votes
after the first vote from each account are ignored.

It is also possible to make any transaction phased without needing voting for
approval. This can be used to create transactions with deferred execution.

Pay on reveal secret is supported as a voting model for phased transactions.
When this voting model is used, the phased transaction must include the
hash of a secret chosen by the sender (up to 100 bytes long), and an approval
transaction for it is only accepted if it includes the secret that results in
this hash. It does not matter who the sender of the approval transaction is,
unless a whitelist is also defined. Supported hash functions currently are
sha256, ripemd160, and sha256 followed by ripemd160. The codes to specify them
as parameters are available from the getConstants API.

Finally, it is possible to make a phased transaction that is released or
rejected not on the basis of voting, but based on the presence of other
transactions (linked transactions) in the blockchain at its finish height.
To do that, up to 10 phasingLinkedFullHash transaction hashes can be defined
when creating the phased transaction. Note that this does not create a
dependency between the linked transactions themselves. This feature can be
used to implement atomic execution of transactions of any type, provided the
phased transaction is phasing safe. Transactions already in the blockchain
before the acceptance of the phased transaction can also be linked, as long
as they are not more than 60 days old, or themselves phased transactions.

The deferred execution with no approval needed, pay on reveal secret, and
linked transactions features are currently accessible using the API only, the
UI for them will be completed in a later release.

Similar to voting, the phasing data for phased transaction that finished before
the last trim height is also deleted and only the aggregate approval results
are kept.

The fee for making a transaction phased depends on the voting model selected.
For by-account voting with no minimum balance, or no voting needed, it is 1 NXT
in addition to the regular fee for that particular transaction type. For voting
that depends on voter balances, the additional phasing fee is 20 NXT.

The fee for approving a phased transaction is 1 NXT for each phased
transaction included in the vote.


Variable size messages, encrypted messages, digital goods deliveries. After VS
block, messages and encrypted messages will be allowed to be up to 40 kbytes
long instead of 1000 bytes, with 1 NXT fee for each 1024 bytes. Digital goods
deliveries can also be up to 40 kbytes, with 1 NXT fee for each 1024 bytes
after the first 10k. A single transaction is always limited not to exceed the
maximum block payload length, currently 255 * 176 bytes.


Other new APIs:

GetOrderTrades - given an askOrder, bidOrder, or both, returns all trades that
were executed as a result of this order.

GetDGSExpiredPurchases - returns the purchases for a given seller which have
expired without being delivered.

GetDGSTagsLike - returns all Digital Goods Store tags starting with a given
(at least 2 characters long) prefix.

GetAliasesLike - returns all Aliases starting with a given (at least 2
characters long) prefix.

SearchAccounts - full text search on account info (name and description).

GetPlugins - returns a list of all installed plugins.

DumpPeers - returns all active peers of a certain version.

Shutdown - shuts down the server. Takes an optional scan parameter, if true
the derived tables are truncated and a full rescan with validation is scheduled
on next start. The resulting nxt_db folder is smaller, and a node bootstrapped
with this database is going to verify the blockchain and rebuild all derived
tables on start. While this ensures validity of the blockchain and all tables,
it cannot verify that this is the current consensus blockchain and not a fork,
therefore providing such a database for download is still not trustless.

GetLog - returns the most recent log messages, kept in a memory buffer.

GetStackTraces - returns the stack traces of the currently running threads.

Shutdown, getLog and getStackTraces require the admin password.


Changed APIs:

CreateTransaction - to facilitate debugging and to allow preparing transaction
bytes and json even for transactions that are currently invalid, if broadcast
parameter is false, all relevant transaction fields (json, bytes, hash, etc)
are still included in the result even in the case of invalid transaction.
If broadcast=true, those fields are returned only in case of successful
transaction broadcast, otherwise only the error messages are returned.
This change affects all APIs that end up creating a new transaction.

GetConstants - in addition to adding the new transaction types and subtypes,
and the voting models, the format of the resulting json has been changed.

Added optional timestamp parameter to getExchanges and getTrades.

Added optional account parameter and pagination support to getCurrencyFounders.

Always include errorCode and errorDescription in some API results that only had
an error field in case of an error.

Limit number of records returned by all APIs that support pagination to
nxt.maxAPIRecords at a time (default 100), unless the admin password is
provided or is not needed.

AddPeer adds an isNewlyAdded boolean to the returned peer json, indicating
whether the peer was not already known.


Client changes:

Extended UI in the "advanced" transaction modal dialog for every transaction 
type for invoking the different variants of phased transactions (to be approved
by a certain number of accounts or balance/asset/currency holders).

New main sidebar item for the Voting System, modal to create the various types
of polls, pages to find active polls and follow polls over time, list with own
polls and votes casted.

Generic notification system for incoming transactions showing the number
of transaction types and total new transactions.

Unconfirmed transactions are only displayed in the "Dashboard" and
"My Transactions" pages and no longer appear in other tables.

Transaction info dialog for AE Bid and Ask orders now displays a table
containing the actual trades matching the specific order.

New account login feature for faster login just by Nxt account.

User specific client DB with new logout option to clear user data.

Streamlined sidebar/navigation structure.

Send Currency button added to the toolbar which invokes the transfer currency
dialog

Environment information, client settings and various diagnostic information is
logged to the browser's JavaScript console during startup and login.

Phasing tab was added to the transaction info dialog of phased transactions.

Various bug fixes.


Client Plugin System:

Functionality - The NRS client comes with a new plugin system, enabling third
party developers to provide additional functionality for the client. Plugins
can be activated/deactivated on startup, the status of installed plugins can be 
seen on a separate settings page. Plugins can hook into the new "Plugins" 
sidebar navigation item or provide their own navigation structure.

Security - Plugins are not sandboxed or restricted in any way and have full 
access to client functionality including the passphrase. It is essential to only 
install plugins from trusted sources and in doubt don't use plugins together
with accounts storing larger amounts of NXT. There are prominent security 
warnings both on the login page and within the plugins folder.

Installation - A Plugin is provided as an archived file containing the necessary
HTML/JS/CSS files and can be installed by extracting the file in the plugins/
client directory.

Developer - For a plugin to be valid is has to follow a certain minimal file
structure and be shipped with a manifest.json file with some meta information.
Detailed information can be found in the DEVELOPERS.md file in the plugins/
directory. There is also a "hello_world" example plugin to get an idea how
things work.


Other important changes:

Fixed transaction ordering in AE order matching to always be by transaction
index instead of by id, to take effect after Voting System Block.

Enforce nxt.adminPassword if set, even if the APIServer is listening on
localhost only.

Added nxt.ignorePeerAnnouncedAddress and nxt.cjdnsOnly properties, relevant
only for cjdns users or multihomed nodes.

Default initial peers are now stored in nxt.defaultPeers and
nxt.testnetDefaultPeers instead of being populated by NxtDbVersion on database
creation.

Allow the API server to handle both http and https requests on different ports,
if nxt.apiServerSSLPort is set to a port different from nxt.apiServerPort and
nxt.apiSSL=true. If the SSL and non-SSL ports are configured to be the same,
the nxt.apiSSL property determines whether SSL is used or not. On testnet,
non-SSL port is hardcoded to 6876 and SSL, if enabled, to 6877.

Reduced the default nxt.maxRollback to 800. Also added a nxt.trimFrequency
setting to control how often the trim is run, default 1000.

This release requires Java 8 and will not run or compile with Java 7.

run.bat has been updated to search for a Java 8 installation using the Windows
registry.

Updated Jetty to version 9.2.10 and Bouncy Castle to version 1.52. If unpacking
on top of a previous installation, delete the old lib folder first.

This release will perform a database upgrade with a full rescan on first start.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.18:

This is a bugfix release. Everyone is required to update.

Set the content type to "text/plain; charset=UTF-8" when sending http requests
to peers. This is an important bug fix, as the incorrect encoding of outgoing
blocks and transactions containing some Unicode characters can prevent their
propagation and lead to forks.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.17:

This is a critical bugfix release. Everyone is required to update.

Fixed validation of asset exchange order cancellations.

Fixed excessive memory usage in unconfirmed transaction processing.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.16:

Updated jetty to version 9.2.9 due to a critical security bug:

http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jetty-announce/msg00074.html

There are no code changes, only the jetty libraries have been updated.
Delete the old lib folder before unpacking on top of a previous installation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.15:

Possible fix for the invalid CurrencyMint counter exception.

Made URLs in descriptions clickable and fixed potential XSS exploit problem.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.14:

Added debugging output for failing currency mint transactions.

Reduced default numberOfForkConfirmations to 2.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.13:

Peer networking improvements, better logging, bugfixes.

News page now loads correctly when the wallet uses https.
Nxt forum message updates are displayed instead of new topics.
Feed refresh is performed whenever the news page is refreshed.

Minor UI bugfixes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.12:

Improved fork resolution by allowing a better difficulty block pushed from a
peer to replace the current last block.

When forging, do not accept a peer block with hit time after the next hit time
of a currently forging account (i.e. prevent front-running in forging).

Removed the possibility of a forger to miss his turn. Even if late, the block
will still be generated and submitted.

Delay forging and submission of blocks by 20 s, configurable via the
nxt.forgingDelay property, in order to be able to accumulate more transactions
in the forged block. The arrival of a front-running block from a peer however
cancels that delay and the next block is generated up to 3 s earlier instead,
which can be controlled via the nxt.forgingSpeedup property.

The above time shifts apply to the physical time of block generation and
submission only. Block timestamps are always fixed by the forging algorithm
within 1 s accuracy, and are not possible to modify.

Better logging of peer networking errors. Log, but do not blacklist missing or
malformed JSON responses.

UI for adding and blacklisting peers. Blacklisting from the UI is possible
only when admin password is not needed (disabled or running on localhost).

Database optimization. Moved the public key of accounts, transaction senders,
and block forgers to a separate table, resulting in 15% reduction of total
database size. This change will be performed at first start and will take some
time. A shutdown after the first start is recommended to compact the database.

Forging API improvements: getForging and stopForging now allow access using
admin password instead of account secret phrase. This respectively retrieves
the status of, or stops the forging of, all currently forging accounts. As
with other admin password protected APIs, password is not required when the
API server is listening on the localhost interface only. The getState API now
also returns a needsAdminPassword boolean, to indicate this.

Enforce that the nxt-default.properties file used matches the version of the
current release.

Added currency distribution dialog invoked using a link from the currency
transaction info dialog.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.11:

Fixed a bug in transaction validation that could break blockchain downloading.
The default (and minimum allowed) value for nxt.maxRollback is now 1441.

Restrict maximum HTTP request and response size in peer networking to prevent
potential out of memory attacks.

Ctrl-C can now stop the server without having to wait for initial rescan to
complete.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.10:

Improved display of blockchain downloading status in the client UI.

Added client translations, changed state from beta to stable for the following
languages: Italian, Dutch, Ukrainian.

Fixed a bug in transaction bytes parsing which could cause signature
verification failed errors and break forging.

When downloading the blockchain, require at most one fork confirmation when
still below the last hardcoded checkpoint (currently MS block).

New API calls for peer management: addPeer and blacklistPeer. AddPeer will add
a peer address or IP, optionally with port number, to the list of known peers
and will try to connect to it. BlacklistPeer (password protected) will
blacklist a peer, for the default blacklisting period.

These APIs, and a few others related to peer networking, have been grouped under
a new Networking tab on the /test page.

Peer port handling has been improved to allow different peers to share the same
IP address provided they use different ports.

To prevent overloading a node with invalid peer addresses, the maximum total
number of known peers is limited to nxt.maxNumberOfKnownPeers (default 2000).
Once this number has been reached, new peer addresses are not added, and peers
that have been last connected to more than a week ago are removed from the known
peer list, provided the node has enough connected public peers, until the number
of known peers is again reduced to below nxt.minNumberOfKnownPeers (default
1000).

Improved database performance by storing currency supply and reserve per unit
data in a separate table.

This release will perform a rescan on first start.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.7. If unpacking on top of a previous installation,
delete your lib directory first to remove the old jetty libraries.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.9:

Server Logic
============
Password protect the Debug APIs. The nxt.enableDebugAPI property is no longer
used. Instead, the debug APIs which allow direct manipulation of the blockchain
database are always enabled, but are now protected with a password, which needs
to be set in the nxt.adminPassword property. Password is not required when the
API server is listening on the localhost interface only (the default).
The password protection can be disabled by setting
nxt.disableAdminPassword=true.

Some refactoring to allow creation and signing of transactions using the Java
API even in the complete absence of blockchain data, as needed for the
MintWorker.

Minor peer networking improvement, addPeers and processBlock requests are now
executed in the background.

Improvements in fork resolution. The peer networking getNextBlocks API no longer
limits the number of blocks returned to 1 MB total payload size, but always
returns 720 blocks, if available.


MintWorker
==========
Added nxt.mint.stopOnError property, default false. Minting will now continue,
by default, even after an error occurred when sending the mint transaction to 
the server.

Minting transactions are now signed locally and sent to the server using the
broadcastTransaction API. Thus the secretPhrase for the minting account is never
sent to the server, and the server or the connection to it do not need to be
trusted. The secretPhrase is also not logged to the log output anymore.


User Interface
==============
Added second row of info boxes on Dashboard.

Notifications for incoming messages.

Reworked page navigation.

Account leasing dialog now displays the number of blocks until lease expiration.

Fixed named account links on the transaction info dialog.

Client Translation
==================
Added language selection to welcome screen.

Added translations for monetary system for different languages.

Stable: English, Spanish, French, Lithuanian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian,
Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional)

Beta: German, Finnish, Galician, Croatian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Dutch,
Slovakian, Portuguese, Serbian (Cyrillic), Serbian (Latin), Ukrainian


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.8:

Removed some validations and logic no longer needed after the Monetary System
block.

Added a checkpoint at block 330000.

Various minor UI bugfixes.

Fixed currency search. Fixed handling of very high minting difficulties.
Fixed concurrency issues with Scrypt minting, can use multiple threads now.

Allow use of https for submitting minting transactions, set
nxt.mint.useHttps=true. Note that this will accept any SSL certificate as valid,
therefore will not protect you against man-in-the-middle attacks when minting.

Allow no more than one unconfirmed minting transaction per account and minted
currency to be accepted in the unconfirmed pool.

Improvements in translations handling, documented in DEVELOPERS-GUIDE.md.

Better validation of hallmarks for peers with multiple addresses. Do not
blacklist peers with invalid hallmarks but just treat them as not hallmarked.

Blacklist peers with versions older than 1.4.

As more than 720 blocks have passed since the MS block, nodes older than 1.4
are now on a fork that will not be resolved by itself. To fix that, upgrading
such nodes from a version older than 1.4 to this release will cause deletion
and full download of the blockchain.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.7.1:

Always enable Monetary System menu in the UI as we are after block 330000 now.

There are no other changes from 1.4.7.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.7:

This is a mandatory update. Everyone should update to 1.4.7 or later before
block 330000.

The Message Pattern in AccountInfo feature, introduced in 1.4.0e, has been
disabled, and will not be activated at block 330000. This is to prevent
possible denial of service attacks by malicious regular expression patterns
which can cause excessive CPU load with certain inputs. This feature will
probably be introduced again in 1.5, but with a predefined set of allowed
well behaved regex patterns.

Multiple minor UI improvements and bugfixes.

Enhanced nxt.allowedBotHosts property to also accepts a range of addresses
using CIDR notation.

159306.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.3e:

Added availableOnly parameter to getBuyOffers and getSellOffers, to return
only exchange offers with non-zero supply and limit, default false. This
parameter is however ignored when both currency and account are specified in
the above APIs.

Added getExchangesByOffer API to get executed currency exchanges for an offer.

Do not log currency exchanges of zero amount.

Fixed setting of peer state. Improvements in connecting to peers.

159306.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.1e:

This is a bugfix release following 1.4.0e.

Fixed Currency Exchange Booth not working. Fixed currency decimals issue.

Fixed minor bugs in MS transaction validation.

Show total alias count in aliases page. Alias deletion and dividend payment
UI fixes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.4.0e:

This is the experimental release to test the new Monetary System major feature.
It is enabled on testnet, and those running testnet nodes should upgrade to this
release, even if they don't plan to use the MS features, otherwise will be left
on a fork. This release is also possible to run on main net, but is not to be
considered stable for production use there. The Monetary System block is not yet
defined for main net.


New features:

Monetary System. See
https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issue/205/monetary-system-documentation
for a detailed description.
See https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issue/207/mint-worker-utility for a
description of the MintWorker tool for currency minting.

Dividend payment transaction. Asset issuers can make a dividend payment to all
asset holders with a single transaction. Required parameters are the blockchain
height at which asset holders shares will be counted (must be less than 1440
blocks in the past), and the amount to be paid per share.

Delete alias transaction. The owner of an alias can now delete it completely,
thus making the alias available for anyone to reserve again if desired.

Message pattern in AccountInfo. An account owner can set a regular expression
pattern in the AccountInfo for his account, using the setAccountInfo API.
Once such a pattern has been set, incoming transactions to this account are only
accepted if they contain a plain text message which matches this pattern. The
syntax follows the java.util.regex.Pattern specification.


API changes:

After MS block, adding a public key announcement when sending a transaction to
an account without a public key will be optional.

Added withMessage boolean parameter to getAccountTransactions and 
getAccountTransactionIds APIs, to return only transactions having a message
attachment, either non-encrypted or decryptable by the account.

Added optional includeLessors, includeAssets, and includeCurrencies boolean
parameters to getAccount API. Set to false when retrieving those data is not
needed, in order to improve the getAccount performance.

After MS block, sending messages, selling aliases, and leasing balances, to the
Genesis account, will be disallowed.

The popOff debug API now allows pop off of more than max rollback number of
blocks, triggering a full rescan in such case.


Internal changes:

After the Monetary System block, the order in which transactions in a block are
executed will be determined by the block forger, instead of by id, default being
by arrival time at the forger's node.

Improvements in blockchain download to prevent getting stuck on the wrong fork.
Nodes will download blocks in batches of not more than 719 blocks at a time
from a single peer, and after each such batch will verify  with
nxt.numberOfForkConfirmations other peers (default 5) if this is the best
fork, before continuing, unless the downloaded batch is of less than 10 blocks.

Rescan status is now saved in the database, to prevent the database from being
left in an inconsistent state when a rescan fails or is interrupted. Once a
rescan has been scheduled, it will be triggered again at restart, until it
completes successfully.

Improvements in the processing of unconfirmed transactions.

This release will perform a rescan on first start.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.3.5:

Added getDGSTagCount API, allow getDGSGoodsCount and getDGSPurchaseCount to be
used also to get total goods or purchase counts.

Added completed parameter to getDGSGoodsPurchases, getDGSGoodsPurchaseCount,
getDGSPurchaseCount, getDGSPurchases, to allow querying for completed purchases
only. Added withPublicFeedbacksOnly parameter to getDGSPurchaseCount.

Secondary sort of search results after sorting by relevance, by timestamp if
for any seller, or by name and then by timestamp if for a single seller.

Improved performance of Marketplace page, show counts for goods in stock only.

Increased default purchase delivery deadline to 168 hours (1 week).

Include full peer info in getPeers API if includePeerInfo=true, to avoid having
to do a separate getPeer request for each peer.

Include cumulativeDifficulty in the block JSON.

Allow transaction signing in signTransaction to skip the validation of the
transaction bytes being signed, if an optional validate=false parameter is
added. This would be useful when signing transaction bytes on a machine that
doesn't have the full blockchain downloaded, which normally prevents validation.

Allow sending messages with no recipient.

Automatically blacklist peers with version older than 1.2.0.

UI improvements of the API /test page.

Changed nxt-default.properties to enable MVCC by default, to avoid database lock
timeout errors.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.6. If unpacking on top of a previous installation,
delete your lib directory first to remove the old jetty libraries.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.3.4:

This release is focused on improving the Nxt Marketplace (Digital Goods
Store) by adding search and browse capabilities.

Implemented full text search using the Lucene library, as supported by H2.
Table columns currently indexed are asset.name, asset.description,
goods.name, goods.tags, goods.description. A rebuild of the search index
can be forced using the luceneReindex debug API.

The full text search query parameter supports the standard Lucene syntax, which
makes AND, OR, phrase queries, or wildcard queries possible. The default
query operator is OR, to do an AND search need to specify AND between keywords
explicitly.

Added searchAssets API which takes a query parameter and returns assets
having name or description matching the query.

Added searchDGSGoods API which takes a query parameter and returns goods
having name, tags, or description matching the query. The results can also
be restricted to a specific seller, goods in stock only, or goods with a
specific tag only.

getDGSPurchases API now takes an optional withPublicFeedbacksOnly parameter.
If true, results are filtered to include only purchases with public feedbacks.

Added getDGSGoodsPurchases API to retrieve purchases for a specific goods,
optionally those with public feedbacks only.

Added getDGSTags API returning all DGS Goods tags, sorted by number of goods
in stock with that tag and total number of goods with that tag. Takes an
optional inStockOnly parameter, default true, to retrieve tags for goods in
stock only. At most three tags per goods are used, tags longer than 20
characters or shorter than 3 are ignored, and the parsing of tags is done using
the Lucene StandardAnalyzer.

Show purchase counts and public feedback counts in all API responses returning
Goods JSON, unless includeCounts parameter is false.

Include total numbers of Goods, Purchases, and Tags in the getState API.

Added getAccountAssetCount, getAliasCount, getDGSGoodsCount,
getDGSGoodsPurchaseCount, getDGSPurchaseCount APIs, to be able to retrieve the
corresponding total counts directly.

To populate the tags table in the database, a blockchain rescan will be done at
first start.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.5. If unpacking on top of a previous installation,
delete your lib directory first to remove the old jetty libraries.


UI changes:

The Marketplace page now shows a listing of tag keywords, ordered by number of
goods in stock with that tag. Clicking on each tag brings the list of goods
having that tag. Searching for goods is now possible using keywords from the
goods name, description, or tags. The list of goods also display the number of
completed purchases, and for goods with a public feedback available, a link to
display that feedback.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.3.3:

Fixed incorrect guaranteed balance bug in getAccountLessors API.

Added getAccountBlockCount API returning number of forged blocks for an account.

Added includeCounts parameter to the getAssets API, to avoid getting trades,
accounts, and transfers counts, if not needed.

Cache hallmarked peer account balances to reduce number of database calls.
Other minor performance improvements and bugfixes.

Fixed decryption of purchased DGS goods. Fixed missing DGS purchase feedbacks.
To repopulate the feedbacks table, this release will perform a blockchain
rescan at first start.

Added a hideDelisted parameter to the getDGSGoods API, default false. If true,
delisted goods are not included in the results. This parameter has effect only
if inStockOnly=false, as delisted goods are considered not to be in stock.

UI bugfixes and improvements. Added themes settings and a corporate theme.
Hide fee input when sending NXT in basic mode, and set to the minimum fee.

Improved the http://localhost:7876/test page interface, allow custom API call
selection, syntax highlighting of the response JSON.

Added getAccountAssets API request, returning account asset balances for the
specified account. If an asset parameter is also specified, only return balance
for that asset. Unlike the getAccount API, this request can also take a height
parameter, to return asset balance as of that height.

Added getAssetAccountCount API request, returning number of accounts holding
the specified asset, again with optional height parameter.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.4. If unpacking on top of a previous installation,
delete your lib directory first to remove the old jetty libraries.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.3.2:

Allow re-broadcasting of transactions already in the unconfirmed pool.

Added clearUnconfirmedTransactions debug API to force clearing of the
unconfirmed transactions pool.

Show correct timestamps in asset transfer history.

Only try to set account public key when inside a database transaction,
fixes a bug in setting public keys for accounts that never had an
outgoing transaction.

getAccountLessors API now returns the guaranteed balance of each lessor
too, as of the height specified in the optional height parameter. The
format of the returned json has been changed to allow adding this
guaranteedBalanceNQT property.

getPeers now accepts an optional "state" parameter, to return only peers
in that state. Possible values: CONNECTED, NON_CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED.
If present, the active=true parameter takes precedence.

getBlock now accepts an optional "timestamp" parameter, to return the
last block as of that timestamp. The parameters to getBlock: "block",
"height", "timestamp", are processed in that order of precedence, i.e.
if both height and timestamp are specified, height is used and timestamp
is ignored. If no parameters, current last block is returned.

getState now accepts an optional "includeCounts" parameter, default true.
If set to false, database table counts, which are slow to retrieve, are
not included in the response.

getTrades, getAllTrades, and getAssetTransfers API now accept an optional
"includeAssetInfo" parameter, default true. If set to false, asset name
and decimals are not included in the result Trade json, and not having to
retrieve those speeds up the request processing.

Added getBlocks API, returning the blocks ordered by height descending,
and using firstIndex, lastIndex parameters for pagination. Restricted to
return up to 100 blocks at a time. If includeTransactions is true, also
includes the full transaction JSON.

Improved default H2 cache size allocation. It nxt.dbCacheKB is not set,
the H2 cache will vary linearly from 16MB for JVM heap size 160MB, to
256MB for heap size 640MB or higher. This should allow low end devices
to run without needing a custom setting for the nxt.dbCacheKB parameter,
and prevent excessive memory use on machines with plenty of memory too.

Disabled the SSLv3 protocol when using SSL for the API.


Client UI improvements:

Added pagination to the Blocks page. The default number of rows per page
can be changed in settings.

Show account balance in the sidebar on all pages.

Improvements and bugfixes in the asset trade and transfer history pages.

New design of the dashboard, and an improved recent transactions list.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.3.1:

This is a critical bugfix release, everyone using 1.3.0 should upgrade.

Fixed a bug in transaction loading which was causing transaction id's and
signatures for some transactions with invalid ecBlock values to change after
saving and reloading from the database.

Report requestProcessingTime in the JSON of all API responses.

Delay loading of block transactions from the database until they are needed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.3.0:

This is the first release which stores all derived objects in the database,
instead of keeping all of them in memory only.

Derived objects are those that are constructed based on the information already
available in the blockchain blocks and transactions - i.e, Accounts, Aliases, 
Assets, Goods, Purchases, Orders, Trades. Storing them in the database instead
of in memory means the Asset Exchange and the Digital Goods Store can scale to
much higher number of assets, orders, and goods, without requiring an ever
growing amount of memory for each node.

Using a standard SQL database tables to store those records also allows for
much more sophisticated queries, and allows third parties to write and execute
custom queries against those tables directly, without being dependent on the NRS
http API only.

By storing the state of all derived objects as of the current height, plus their
state at previous heights up to 1440 blocks back, it is possible to completely
eliminate the need for blockchain rescans on startup, and on fork resolution.

On upgrade from 1.2.8 and older releases, this version will perform an initial
build of the derived objects tables, which on a fast machine takes about 4 min,
but may take longer depending on your hardware. The database size will again
grow during this rescan, but after shutdown should shrink back to around 550 MB.

There will be no rescans on subsequent restarts, and the startup time is now
reduced to a few seconds only. There will also be no rescans at runtime on block
pop offs.

Derived object tables are kept small by trimming them, only records needed to
allow rollback of up to 1440 blocks back are kept. If you need to preserve and
query historical information going back all the way to height 0, this trimming
can be disabled by setting nxt.trimDerivedTables=false (default is true) in
nxt.properties. After changing this property, a rebuild of the derived tables
can be triggered using the new scan API request, see below.

The default number of rollback records kept can be increased while still keeping
trimming enabled, by setting nxt.maxRollback to a higher value (default and
lowest possible is 1440). This should provide a compromise for those who want to
keep history of more than the default 1440 blocks, yet want to avoid the
performance penalty of never trimming the derived objects tables.

To allow for the increased use of database, default max number of database 
connection has been increased to nxt.maxDbConnections=30, and lock timeout
increased to nxt.dbDefaultLockTimeout=60 in nxt-default.properties.

Slower machines and high traffic public nodes may experience database lock
timeouts with the default settings. To prevent those, MVCC mode can be enabled
by appending MVCC=TRUE to the jdbc url in nxt.properties. MVCC is not enabled
by default however, because while providing for higher concurrency under
multiple simultaneous connections, and thus avoiding timeouts, it is also slower
overall and less well tested.

To help with debugging potential bugs, default logging level has been set to
nxt.level=FINE in logging-default.properties for this release, which will cause
more output than usual in the log.


API changes:

The following existing APIs now allow optional pagination using firstIndex,
lastIndex parameters:

getAccountBlockIds, getAccountCurrentAskOrderIds, getAccountCurrentBidOrderIds,
getAliases, getAllAssets, getAllTrades, getAskOrderIds, getBidOrderIds,
getAskOrders, getBidOrders, getAssetIds, getAssetsByIssuer.

The limit parameter is no longer accepted by the getAskOrderIds, getBidOrderIds,
getAskOrders and getBidOrders APIs, as firstIndex/lastIndex parameters are now
used instead for pagination.

getAccountBlockIds in addition to allowing pagination now returns the blocks
in descending order, as this is more useful when showing the newest blocks
on top in the client.

getTrades now accepts an optional account parameter, in addition to asset, to
allow retrieving trade history for a specific account, for either all assets or
a specific asset only.

getUnconfirmedTransactions and getUnconfirmedTransactionIds now also accept
the RS account number format.

The Trade JSON now includes buyer and seller account ids, the height at which
the trade occurred, the asset name, and the heights at which the ask and bid
orders were accepted in the blockchain.

The Asset JSON now includes total number of transfers, and number of accounts
holding the asset.

parseTransaction does not just return an error when trying to parse an invalid
transaction bytes or JSON, but adds a validate=false field, plus the actual
error message, in addition to the parsed transaction JSON.

getState no longer includes total effective balance.


New API requests:

getAccountBlocks - like getAccountBlockIds, but returning full block JSON.
If includeTransactions parameter is true, also includes the transaction JSON.

getAccountCurrentAskOrders and getAccountCurrentBidOrders - 
like getAccountCurrentAskOrderIds and getAccountCurrentBidOrderIds, but
returning full order JSON.

getAllOpenAskOrders and getAllOpenBidOrders now replace getAllOpenOrders, but
only returning ask or bid orders respectively, and allow firstIndex/lastIndex
pagination.

getAssetTransfers - retrieves the asset transfers for an asset, account, or
both, sorted by height descending.

getAssetAccounts - accepts an asset parameter and returns all accounts holding
this asset as of the current height, and the asset quantity each one owns,
sorted by asset quantity descending.
Takes an optional height parameter to allow retrieving asset holders as of a
previous blockchain height.

getAccountLessors - retrieves the accounts that have leased their balance to the
specified account, takes an optional height parameter to allow querying previous
blockchain heights.

The historical height query feature in getAssetAccounts and getAccountLessors
depends on the specified height records still being available, i.e. either table
trimming disabled, or maxRollback set high enough to cover that height.

longConvert - an utility API to convert between signed long ids as used in the
database and unsigned long ids represented as strings. Accepts an id in either
form and returns both the signed and unsigned versions.

getECBlock - returns the ecBlockId and ecBlockHeight given an optional
timestamp, current time if not supplied.


New debug API requests:

The following requests are used for debugging purposes only and should not
normally be needed. They are disabled by default, set nxt.enableDebugAPI=true in
the properties to enable them. Do not enable on a public node where the API is
accessible to anyone.

fullReset - delete and redownload the whole blockchain.

popOff - accepts a numBlocks or height parameters, and pops off that many blocks
or back to that height. If table trimming is enabled (default), at most 1440
blocks can be popped off. Derived object tables are rolled back to the specified
height and blocks and transactions after that height are deleted.

scan - accepts a numBlocks or height parameters, rolls back the derived object
tables to that height and rebuilds them by rescanning the existing blockchain
from that height up again. Does not delete blocks or transactions from the
blockchain, unlike the popOff request. A request to rescan more than 1440 blocks
when table trimming is enabled will do a full rescan starting from height 0.
Setting validate parameter to true will also re-verify signatures and
re-validate blocks and transactions during the rescan.


DbShellServlet:

A command line access to the H2 database at runtime is now possible at:
http://localhost:7876/dbshell
This page uses the H2 shell tool to allow querying the database at runtime,
directly from the browser, without having to enable auto server mode in the jdbc
url. This servlet is only enabled if nxt.enableDebugAPI=true, and is very unwise
to enable on a publicly accessible node as it allows full read and write access
to the database.


The usability of the http://localhost:7876/test API access page has been further
improved.


Packaging changes:

To prevent intentional misunderstanding of why jar files hashes are never
reproducible, the class files are now left unpacked in a classes subdirectory
after compilation, instead of being packaged in a nxt.jar file. The run.sh and
run.bat scripts have been modified to include this directory on the classpath
instead of the nxt.jar file. Those who still prefer to build a nxt.jar file, can
easily do that with the included jar.sh script, and modify the classpath to use
it. A pre-built nxt.jar file will still be included for a few releases, as it
is expected by the restart code when upgrading from an older version, but is not
otherwise used.


Other internal changes:

Everywhere, object ids that used to be Longs are now primitive longs, as their
use as HashMap keys is no longer needed.

Preserve and re-process unconfirmed transactions after fork resolution pop-off.
Improved propagation of unconfirmed transactions.

Multiple minor improvements and optimizations based on profiling results.

Merged in code to enable future variable fees based on transaction type and
transaction size.

Updated Jetty to version 9.2.3.

Added an option to disable transaction re-broadcasting by setting the property
nxt.enableTransactionRebroadcasting to false (default is enabled).


Testnet:

This release will reset the testnet blockchain back to height 77431. Testnet
nodes staying with 1.2.8 are already on a different fork.


There is no urgency to upgrade on main net, both 1.2.8 and 1.3.0 versions can
coexist on the network and there is no hard fork involved. The local database
changes however are not reversible, if you upgrade to 1.3.0 and decide to go
back to 1.2.8, you will need to delete the nxt_db folder and re-download the
blockchain.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.8:

API changes:

The timestamp parameter in getAccountTransactionIds and getAccountTransactions
now refers to the timestamp of the block in which the transaction was included
rather than the transaction timestamp itself. Transactions are sorted in
descending order of block timestamp and transaction id, instead of transaction
timestamp. This is so that the sorting matches the order in which transactions
are processed, and because transactions with earlier timestamps may appear in
the blockchain after transactions with later timestamps have already been
processed, thus being unintentionally skipped while navigating the transactions
list by transaction timestamp.

The getAccountTransactionIds and getAccountTransactions requests now accept an
optional numberOfConfirmations parameter, which can be used to retrieve only
transactions with at least numberOfConfirmations number of confirmations.

The getBlock API now optionally accepts height instead of block parameter, to
retrieve the block at that height. If both block and height are specified,
height parameter is ignored.

The getBlock API now also accepts includeTransactions parameter, if set to
true, full transaction JSON is returned instead of only transaction ids.

There are no other changes between 1.2.7 and 1.2.8, so those who rely on the
old behavior of the above APIs can continue to use 1.2.7 for the time being.

Client GUI: 

Added the option for merchants to specify a specially formatted message that
is required to be added to a payment transaction or an asset transfer.

To activate this behavior, you must set your account info description to the
following format: #merchant:[0-9]+#

This example will only accept a numeric message.

If the message should be of a particular length use this: 
#merchant:[a-zA-Z0-9]{4,8}#

This format will only allow messages that have a length of 4 to 8 characters 
and is alphanumeric.

Note that the regex is case sensitive.

Fixed issue with public key field not showing when using a contact in the
recipient field.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.7:

No longer allow creation of pre-DGS block transactions, and ignore such
transactions received from old version peers on a fork.

Improvements in exception handling, transaction validation, error logging.
Updated run.bat file. Blacklist unreachable peers on connection timeout.
Prevent server from starting if any of the startup tasks failed.

Added an optional "active" parameter to the getPeers API request. If true,
only active peers are returned (those in state CONNECTED or DISCONNECTED).

Avoid unnecessary DNS queries.

No longer process or return "comment" parameters in Asset Transfer.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.6:

Preserve unconfirmed transactions during rescan instead of relying on being
able to get them again from peers.

Keep retrying the block generation in the case it fails due to an invalid
transaction. Prevent block generation failures due to minimum transaction size
changes.

Ignore peer weights in choosing a random peer when hallmark protection is
disabled (it is enabled by default). When hallmark protection is enabled, the
nxt.maxNumberOfConnectedPublicPeers count is now based on hallmarked peers only,
i.e. the node will keep trying to connect to more peers until it is connected
to at least that many hallmarked peers.

Added peer networking addPeers request. After sending a getPeers request and
processing the response, the peer will also send to the other peer all peer
addresses it is connected to which are not present in the other peer's peers
set, to improve the propagation of peer addresses through the network.

Minor bugfixes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.5f:

Bugfixes. Keep retrying block generation when failing due to invalid
transactions.

Ignore peer weights when hallmark protection is disabled. Set hallmark
protection to disabled by default as it can break blockchain downloading in some
cases. This is a change in nxt-default.properties.


The changelog from 1.2.5b is repeated below:


This release disables all outgoing transactions from the BTER account:
10715382765594435905 after block height 209885.

If you use this release, existing blocks after that height will be deleted,
but the transactions in them preserved and reprocessed, except those originating
from the BTER account, and those with deadline already expired.

A rescan with validation will be performed automatically at start, it will take
longer and perform another rescan at the end.

This is an optional release. Forgers have a choice whether to use it, or stay
with the old 1.2.5 release, the community needs to decide whether to do the
rollback or stay with the old fork.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.5d:

I am uploading the fork release again so that those who want to form a fork are
not prevented from doing it.

Bugfixes. Prevent pulling blockchain from nodes not running this release, in
order to allow forging of a fork.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.5:

Added peer networking gzip compression. It is enabled by default, and will make
downloading of the blockchain faster, but in case it causes extra load on your
public node can be disabled by setting nxt.enablePeerServerGZIPFilter=false in
nxt.properties.

Enabled serving gzip compressed static resources (html, javascript, css files)
by the API Server. This would make loading the wallet UI from remote servers
faster. The compressed .gz files are included in the installation package.

Allow gzip compression of API Server responses too, however this is disabled
by default. This would be helpful when running the server on a remote machine,
for online wallets and service providers, to enable it set
nxt.enableAPIServerGZIPFilter=true in nxt.properties.

Fixed client-side rescanning bug that caused UI to appear outdated.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.4:

Fixed important bugs affecting arbitrary message and asset transfer transactions
before DGS block.

Minor client UI bugfixes.

Updated jquery to version 2.1.1 and bootstrap to version 3.2.0.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.3:

Everyone should upgrade to 1.2.3 before block 213000.

Those upgrading from the previous stable release, 1.1.6 or earlier, should also
consult the changelogs for 1.2.0e, 1.2.1e and 1.2.2e for important changes
introduced in the 1.2 branch.

Minor bugfixes.

ParseTransaction, signTransaction, and broadcastTransaction API can now accept
transaction in JSON format instead of transaction bytes.

Moved DGS block forward, will be enabled at 213000 instead of 210000.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.2e:

This is still a test release intended to get testnet working. Please update
your testnet nodes.

Bugfixes in transaction attachment versioning and version validation.

Added encrypt-to-self message attachment type. Any transaction can optionally
have such an attachment, intended to be used for private notes that only the
transaction sender can read. This feature is not yet supported by the GUI.

Added nxt.isOffline property. If set to true in nxt.properties, peer networking
will not start, no peers will be loaded from the database, and no outgoing
connections will be made.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.1e:

This release is still considered experimental, but is now enabled to run on main
net too. The DGS milestone block is set to 210000 for main net. A stable release
is expected before that, but all exchanges and websites should already start
trying the 1.2.1e release, because the upgrade to 1.2.2 stable will be mandatory
before block 210000.

Multiple bugfixes in DGS and Alias Transfer transaction validation. Restricted
some types of alias and DGS transactions to one per alias / DGS purchase per
block.

Alias sale transactions now use null recipient instead of genesis when the sale
is open to any buyer. Alias buy transaction uses amountNQT instead of priceNQT
parameter, as the price is being stored in the amount field anyway.

GetDGSGoods request now always skips delisted goods.

Improved handling of IPv6 addresses.

Improved the http://localhost:7876/test interface by adding support for tagging
of API requests in multiple categories. All http API requests are now classified
under separate tabs for easier navigation.

Reduced startup time by running in parallel the initial peer loading and address
resolution, and the initial blockchain scanning.

To improve database performance, transactions that do not have a recipient now
have null instead of the genesis account id as recipient in the transactions
table. Such transactions will also not have a recipient field in their JSON.

Added support for pagination to the getAccountTransactionIds API. The results
are now returned sorted by timestamp in descending order.

Added getAccountTransactions API also returning the full transactions json.

Refresh peer info for already connected peers every hour.

Call setReuseAddress(true) for all jetty ServerConnectors.

Refactoring of transaction attachment handling. Added support for transaction
versions and global options. Transactions will switch to version 1 at DGS block.

Added Message and EncryptedMessage attachments that can be attached to any
transaction types, and can have either text or binary content. All APIs that
create a new transaction now accept additional parameters to allow attaching
a Message or EncryptedMessage (or both). This removes the need for creating
new transaction types for encrypted messages or payments with messages.

After DGS milestone block, Asset Transfer transactions can no longer have a
"comment" field. Switch to using a plain text "message" attachment instead.

Added transaction attachment versioning. Transactions of version 1 and later
will have a version field in the attachment too, which allows future optional
changes to one attachment type only, e.g. adding expiration field to asset issue
attachment without having to add a new transaction type.

Added PublicKeyAnnouncement attachment. Those will be accepted after DGS block,
but only enforced after block 215000. After that block, transactions with
recipient account that does not have a public key will be required to have such
an attachment in order to announce and set the public key of the recipient.
To add a PublicKeyAnnouncement, just add a "recipientPublicKey" parameter with
the hex-encoded public key string when sending the first transaction to that
account. It is harmless (but useless) to keep adding the same recipientPublicKey
for further transactions to the same account. But trying to set a different
public key for an account that already has a public key will result in rejection
of the transaction.

The getAccountId request can be used to get the public key for a secret phrase 
(even when not yet announced to the blockchain).

Added first part of Economic Clustering - fork detection. After DGS block, each
transaction will include a reference to a recent blockId. For now this is used
only to detect forks, and transactions referring to a different fork are still
not rejected.

Next step of Transparent Forging will be enabled at block 215000: accounts that
miss their turn to forge will not be able to forge for the next one hour.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.2 and bouncycastle to version 1.51.

This release will cause a reset of testnet, deleting blocks and transactions
after block 117907.

Client Updates:

Redesign login page.

Multilingual interface. Some translations are incomplete and still considered
experimental.

Most forms now allow you to add an encrypted or public message to them.

Added public key announcement support.

Passphrase login length check.

Automatically enable certain features at DGS block.

Several DGS bug fixes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.2.0e:

This release will run only on testnet. Set nxt.isTestnet=true in nxt.properties.

New features:

Digital goods store.

New http API calls for creating transactions: 
dgsListing, dgsDelisting, dgsPriceChange, dgsQuantityChange, dgsPurchase,
dgsDelivery, dgsRefund, dgsFeedback

New http API calls for querying DGS:
getDGSGood, getDGSGoods, getDGSPurchase, getDGSPurchases, getDGSPendingPurchases

Goods and notes exchanged between buyer and seller are encrypted with AES, and
gzip compressed before encryption. Maximum allowed digital goods size is 10240
bytes after compression and encryption.

Alias transfer.

New http API calls: sellAlias, buyAlias

Alias sale can be restricted to a specific buyer, or open to anyone. Alias sale
with price 0 is treated as immediate transfer and doesn't require a separate buy
alias transaction. To change the ask price, submit a new sellAlias transaction.
To cancel a sale, submit a new sellAlias transaction to yourself with price 0.

Buy alias transaction can only be placed if the alias is already for sale. It is
not currently possible to just bid on an alias that is not for sale.

Encrypted messages.
AES encrypted messages are now supported in the core, so there is no need to use
externally encrypted arbitrary messages anymore. Use arbitrary messages only for
plain text, encrypted messages for confidential messaging.

New APIs: sendEncryptedNote and readEncryptedNote. Max message length is 1000
bytes, after compression and encryption.

New http API calls: encryptTo/decryptFrom can be used for encrypting and
decrypting arbitrary text to/from an account. But those just do the encryption
and decryption, don't actually send messages between accounts.

New rsConvert http query for converting account number to RS format and back.

New getBlockId API to get blockId for a given height.

Improved logging, to handle the case when Nxt is embedded as a library.

Minor improvements: getState and getBlockchainStatus now also show application
name, block JSON also shows generatorPublicKey, getAccountId also accepts
publicKey as a parameter.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.1.

Client Updates: 

Digital Goods Store UI.

Alias Trading UI.

Encrypted Messages.

Only RS account numbers are allowed. Exchanges and services should switch to RS 
format ASAP.

Decode Token Functionality.

Hide Fee / Deadline by default, show via advanced toggle.

Show warning message if user is on a fork (if his account has generated at least
the last 10 blocks).

Several settings (remember passphrase by default, 12/24 hour format).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.1.6:

Fixed logic bugs in unconfirmed transactions handling and detection of double
spending transactions.

Improved performance of getTransactions query.

Added nxt.debugLogUnconfirmed parameter (default false) to control debug logging
of unconfirmed account balances.

Improved UI of the API test servlet, patch submitted by Holger Drewes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.1.5:

Fixed a special case in the calculation of unconfirmed balance. Added additional
checks for account balances.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.1.4:

Aliases http API cleanup. There are only two API requests to get aliases now:

getAlias
parameters: either "aliasName" (the alias name) or "alias" (the alias id)
returns: full Alias JSON

getAliases
parameters: "timestamp" (optional timestamp) and "account" (the account id, 
required)
returns: list of aliases (full JSON) owned by the account, optionally filtered
by timestamp

The old getAliasId, getAliasIds, getAliasURI and listAccountAliases have been
removed as they are redundant and the new requests return all necessary info.

assignAlias has been renamed to setAlias, with "aliasName" and "aliasURI"
parameters.

Removed getAssetsByName API.

The getAssetsByIssuer API now accepts a multivalued "account" parameter and
returns a list of lists of assets issued by those accounts.

Use the slf4j logging framework. Thanks to ScripterRon for adapting our Logger
to use slf4j! The logging can now be configured in conf/logging.properties,
see conf/logging-default.properties for possible parameters and their defaults
and create a new conf/logging.properties file with any custom settings if
needed.

Minor DebugTrace improvements - log Arbitrary Messages events, sender and
recipient, and generated block ids.

Improvements in transaction validation and rescan logic.

Client updates:

No longer shows full list of assets. You must now add assets manually via
either the asset ID or account issuer ID.

Instant asset bookmark search (no enter needed).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.1.3:

Handle undo of initial alias assignment in order to minimize rescans. Clear
unconfirmed transactions maps after rescan instead of before.

Added nxt.forceValidate parameter to allow re-validating blocks and transactions
on startup.

Client Updates:

Make reed solomon account format the default.
Search by reed solomon account number.
Differentiate background color of assets owned in asset sidebar.
Differentiate background color of assets issued in account modal.
Autolink URLs in asset description and alias data.
Show notice on login if an update for NRS is available.
Added a max asset transfer warning setting.
Added a help menu.
Correct amounts on my assets page.
Alias search on aliases page.
Added global unconfirmed transactions to transactions page.
Show quantity of asset available for transfer in asset transfer modal.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.1.2:

Avoid unnecessary fork processing resulting in too many scans.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.1.1:

Fixed forking problem. Hopefully.

Include guaranteedBalanceNQT (1440 confirmations) in getAccount JSON.

Client UI:

Fixed AE display in Safari.

Removed some pre-NQT logic. Make AE visible by default.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.1.0:

Attachments are now stored in the database as byte arrays instead of serialized
objects. The conversion will take place at first start of this version and will
take some time and disk space, but after shutdown the database will shrink back
even more (about 25%).

Added blockchain checkpoint at NQT_BLOCK.

Rely on partially-canonical signatures being enforced after NQT_BLOCK to detect
signature malleability attacks, removed the logic enforcing uniqueness of
transaction hashes (excluding signatures). Only the fullHash (including
signature) is now unique. For this reason, the "hash" property has been removed
from the transaction JSON and only "fullHash" is returned now.

Use full hash instead of id for referenced transactions. Existing transactions
in the database will be reprocessed as part of the database conversion.

Referencing transactions can refer to transactions not more than 60 days back.
This limitation is enforced on the whole length of referenced transactions chain
in case the referenced transaction itself refers to a previous one and so on.
Also the length of such chains is limited to 10 transactions.

Removed some NotYetEnabled checks that are no longer relevant. Removed as much
as possible any obsolete logic that deals with NXT amounts, as all new
transactions will only be created in NQT format now.

More blacklisting of peers that cause RuntimeExceptions.

Trades returned by getTrades API are now in reversed order, most recent first.

Client Updates:

Add unconfirmed transactions to dashboard immediately.

Show appropriate message during rescanning of blockchain.

Limit trade history to last 50 trades.

Show asset buy / sell notifications.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.0.3:

Account.getPublicKey() should return null if the key has not yet been included
in a block. Related to blockchain download stuck at height 133933 bug.

Increased default timeouts in nxt-default.properties.

Client UI:

Fixed NQT parse error.

Fixed scrollbar issue in asset exchange.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.0.2:

Added getUnconfirmedTransactions API, returning the full JSON objects for all
unconfirmed transactions, optionally filtered by account parameter.

Added win-compile.sh script for compiling on windows.

GetForging also shows "remaining" time to forge a block.

Clear Generator state on rescan, likely the cause of repeating scans problem.

Client Updates:

Do not forge automatically when downloading the blockchain.

Wait until blockchain finished downloading before allowing form submits.

Update notification fix.

Make blocks and peers page auto-update.

Show buy/sell notification of assets.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.0.1:

Added getAssetsByIssuer API to get all assets issued by an account.

Added getAskOrders and getBidOrders API calls, returning the full JSON objects.

Added BlockchainProcessor.getLastBlockchainFeederHeight(), to help determine
blockchain download status. Note that this is present only when the current
feeder peer also supports it, i.e. starting from this release.
Added BlockchainProcessor.isScanning() to check for re-scan in progress.

Added getBlockchainStatus API containing the above status, it is more efficient
to use this instead of the getState API.

Enhanced DebugTrace to log lease begin and end events, and lessor guaranteed
balances for each block, in nxt-trace.csv file.

Added server-side support for Reed-Solomon encoding of account numbers, thanks
to ChuckOne who converted the javascript version to java. All API calls that
accept account numbers can now recognize either account id's or Reed-Solomon
addresses. JSON data responses that contain account numbers now also have them
in Reed-Solomon format too.

Added Crypto.getPrivateKey() and Crypto.curve() methods. Added the Bouncy Castle
library, to be used for AES encryption instead of the limited strength default
implementation.

Added Account.getForgedBalanceNQT() to keep track of total forging fees earned
by each account, available as forgedBalanceNQT in getBalance and getAccount.

Increased default database query lock timeout to 10 s, nxt.dbDefaultLockTimeout
in nxt-default.properties.

Re-check unconfirmed pool for double-spending transaction after each block push.

Support for IPv6 connections, patch provided by ScripterRon.

Updated jetty to version 9.1.5. Make sure first to delete the old jetty jar
files from lib if just unpacking this release on top of an older installation.


Client Updates:

Built-in Reed Solomon support. Not enabled by default yet. Go to settings to
change.

Added user warning when amount NXT or fee NXT are higher than maximum specified
in settings.

Added forged balance to dashboard.

Asset exchange is now searchable.

Blockchain download progress uses new API.

Show (unconfirmed) transaction immediately on dashboard after form submit.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-1.0.0:

The old NRS UI is now disabled by default. Only the new UI is available, at
http://localhost:7876

Added Account lease events, Listeners can be registered for LEASE_SCHEDULED,
LEASE_STARTED and LEASE_ENDED. This is of interest to Java API users only.

Minor bugfixes. Avoid new transaction validation errors during blockchain scan.
Removed NotYetEnabled checks for milestone blocks that have already passed.

Added README.txt file, see that for installation and configuration instructions.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.10e:

Added getAllAssets API which retrieves all Assets, and getAssets API which takes
a multivalued "asset" parameter and returns the Assets with corresponding
assetIds.

Added signTransaction API which takes unsignedTransactionBytes and secretPhrase
and returns the signed transactionBytes, transaction id, full hash, and
signature hash. The transaction is not broadcasted.

To prevent denial of service attacks, transactions that need to stay in the
unconfirmed transactions pool, while waiting for their referenced transactions
to arrive, will be charged 100 NXT refundable deposit. This is subtracted from
the unconfirmed balance of the account when the transaction is accepted into the
unconfirmed pool, and is refunded back when the transaction is either confirmed,
or expires and is removed from the pool.

Added Wesley's UI under html/ui, available by default on http://localhost:7876


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.9:

All http APIs that submit a new transaction now allow an optional "broadcast"
parameter. If set to "false", transaction will not be broadcasted, if any other
value, transaction will be broadcasted. Transactions that are not signed will
of course never be broadcasted. The signed and unsigned bytes are always
returned with the transaction JSON, so the signed bytes can be broadcasted
manually later.

Minor bugfixes related to referenced transaction id handling.

The calculation of full transaction hash (and therefore transaction id too) has
been changed, taking effect at NQT_BLOCK. Instead of using signature as part
of the bytes over which the hash is calculated, the sha256 hash of the
signature is now used.

After NQT_BLOCK, the above change will allow a simple way of transaction escrow,
relying on the referenced transaction feature we already have:

Alice prepares and signs a transaction A, but doesn't broadcast it (setting the
broadcast=false parameter introduced in this release). She sends to Bob the
unsigned transaction bytes, the full transaction hash, and the signature hash.
All of those are included in the JSON returned by the API. (Warning: make sure
not to send the signed transaction bytes, or the signature itself, as then Bob
can just broadcast transaction A himself).

Bob prepares, signs and broadcasts transaction B, setting the
referencedTransactionFullHash parameter to the full hash of A provided by Alice.
He can verify that this hash indeed belongs to the transaction he expects from
Alice, by using the new calculateFullHash API, which takes unsigned transaction
bytes and signature hash (both of which Alice has also sent to Bob). He can also
use the parseTransaction API to decode the unsigned bytes and inspect all
transaction fields.

Transaction B is accepted in the unconfirmed transaction pool, but as long as A
is still missing, B will not be confirmed, i.e. will not be included in the
blockchain. If A is never submitted, B will eventually expire - so Bob should
make sure to set a long enough deadline, such as the maximum of 1440 minutes.

Once in the unconfirmed transactions pool, Bob has no way of recalling B back.
So now Alice can safely submit her transaction A, by just broadcasting the
signed transaction bytes she got in the first step. Transaction A will get
included in the blockchain first, and in the next block Bob's transaction B
will also be included.

Note that while the above scheme is good enough for a simple escrow, the
blockchain does not enforce that if A is included, B will also be included. It
may happen due to forks and blockchain reorganization, that B never gets a
chance to be included and expires unconfirmed, while A still remains in the
blockchain. However, it is not practically possible for Bob to intentionally
cause such chain of events and to prevent B from being confirmed.

Because of the change in transaction id calculation, on test net, NQT_BLOCK has
been moved to 76500, which will cause a minor reset deleting blocks after 76000.

On main net NQT_BLOCK is now set to 132000, FRACTIONAL_BLOCK at 134000,
ASSET_EXCHANGE_BLOCK 135000. Any bugs in NQT or AE need to be found and fixed
before that.

The deadline for upgrade to 0.9.9 is block 130000, when the lease balance
feature gets enabled. 0.8.13 nodes will be on a fork after that block.
0.7.7 nodes are most likely already on a fork.

Since the 0.9 branch API accepts amounts in NQT only, any client, website, or
exchange still using amounts in NXT, based on the 0.8 API, should upgrade to
the 0.9 NQT API before block 130000. Otherwise they are stuck with 0.8.13,
which as I said will be on a fork after that block.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.8e:

This release is for testnet only. It will also cause another testnet reset,
so it is required that all testnet nodes update to it.

Switched to using full 256-bit hash for referenced transaction ids. The complete
switch in the use of full hash will only be implemented after NQT_BLOCK, but as
it requires a hard fork again, the change in transaction bytes format from long
to 256-bit hash for referenced transaction is now scheduled to happen at
NQT_BLOCK.

First run will perform some database schema updates again, and will also delete
testnet blocks after 63000. NQT_BLOCK will now be set to 76000 at testnet, so
we have one last chance of testing non-fractional amounts plus the current
referenced transaction changes before and after NQT_BLOCK. Balance leasing will
be enabled on testnet at block 75000 now. After the reset, testnet will start
from block 74590, so we have around 1000 blocks before NQT_BLOCK on testnet.

The transaction fullHash, which includes the signature unlike the other hash
we currently have, is now also available in the transaction JSON. It is also
possible to retrieve a transaction based on its fullHash using getTransaction.

The http API referencedTransactionId parameter has been replaced with
referencedTransactionFullHash, a hex-encoded 256-bit full hash.

The transaction JSON also includes referencedTransactionFullHash, if not null,
and for now also includes referencedTransactionId. Until NQT_BLOCK is passed,
users of this API should really check both, as for transactions before NQT_BLOCK
it cannot be guaranteed that referencedTransactionFullHash is available because
it is not a part of the byte array transaction format. After NQT_BLOCK is
passed, this will be changed to always include referencedTransactionFullHash in
the JSON (also for old transactions), and the referencedTransactionId will be
removed.

Added nxt.usePeersDb to nxt-default.properties, enabled by default. This is to
disable use of saved peer addresses, useful for test purposes only.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.7:

Added parseTransaction API, which takes transactionBytes and returns the JSON
representation of the transaction, including a "verify" boolean whether the
signature verified correctly. Note that the interpretation and validation of 
the bytes is dependent on the current last block height - if it is before or
after NQT_BLOCK.

To avoid becoming dependent on a few centrally controlled public nodes, all
known peers are now regularly saved in the database. When created from scratch,
the database is seeded with 200-300 public peers hardcoded in the DbVersion
code. After that, any time the node fetches new peers from the network, it will
also save them to the peer table, and delete those that are blacklisted or
unreachable at their announced address.

This feature is optional, and the nxt.savePeers parameter can be set to false
in nxt.properties, for those who don't want to leave any trace on their hard
drive regarding which peers their node has been connecting to, to prevent
possible network correlation attacks.

The nxt.wellKnownPeers and nxt.testnetPeers parameters are still used, with 
those peers always added to the database on startup.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.6:

Validate that lease recipient account has public key set before accepting
lease transaction. This check will cause some minor rollback of testnet as
blocks containing such lease transactions will be deleted.

Optimizations in balance leasing. Keep negative values of guaranteed balance
for internal calculations only, effective balance now always non-negative.
Other minor bugfixes and improvements.

Effective balance leasing will be enabled on main net at block 130000.
This means all nodes should be updated to version 0.9.6 or later before that,
or there will be a fork. We have until then to find and fix any serious bugs
in balance leasing. And all clients to be used on main net should have switched
to handle NQT amounts before that, as the 0.9 API only accepts amounts in NQT.
The actual block of transition to NQT will be decided later.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.5e:

Added leaseBalance http API to allow leasing of effective balance. The "period"
parameter, defined in number of blocks, determines the length of the lease.
Minimum period is 1440 blocks, maximum 32767. The lease starts 1440 blocks
after the leaseBalance request is submitted, not immediately. If a lease is
currently in progress and a new lease is submitted, the new lease will take
effect at the end of the current lease, but no earlier than 1440 blocks from
the current block.

During a lease, the whole guaranteed balance of the leasing account, with at
least 1440 confirmations, is added to the effective balance of the recipient
account.

Forging fees are earned only by the recipient (lessee) account, and there is
no mechanism in the blockchain to enforce that the lessee account distributes
back any part of those fees, so it would be up to the forging pool owners to
schedule and perform such redistributions.

Information about lessees and lessors is added to the JSON result of the
getAccount API.

This feature will be enabled on testnet at block 73000 so that it can be
fully tested.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.4e:

Added Digital Goods Store, Effective Balance Leasing, and Hub Terminal
announcement features. Those are still untested, lack an http API, and are
currently disabled even on testnet, so that not to interfere with the testing
of the Asset Exchange.

Enforce canonical signatures and canonical public keys, after NQT_BLOCK.

Added setAccountInfo http API, which uses an Account Info transaction to set
name and description properties of an account. Those fields, if set, will be
returned as part of the getAccount JSON. Account Info will be enabled at
NQT_BLOCK, so it should be working on test net after this release.

Fixed a bug in Asset Transfer quantity handling that was preventing transaction
confirmations on testnet.

Two new properties in nxt-default.properties, to make it easier to import
nxt.trace as csv file:
# Separator character for trace log
nxt.debugTraceSeparator=\t
# Quote character for trace log
nxt.debugTraceQuote="

Jetty has been updated to version 9.1.4, and H2 to version 1.3.176. Make sure
to delete the old versions from the lib directory first, if you do upgrades
just by unpacking the zip file on top of an existing installation.

Bugfixes and improvements in transaction validation. Existing transactions will
be checked once at first start of this version, which may cause some turbulence
on testnet as invalid blocks will be deleted.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.3.1e:

Fixed parsing of Issue Asset transactions, testnet nodes should upgrade.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.3e:

Removed all quantityINT, balanceINT, amountNXT, priceNXT, feeNXT return values
from the JSON API, and removed support for parsing of INT and NXT parameters.
Only NQT (for amounts) and QNT (for quantities) units are supported now.

Enabled running on main net. NQT_BLOCK is set to 150000 for main net, until
then fractional amounts remain disabled. Integer NXT amounts and fees should
work normally on main net too, and this release should be network compatible
with 0.8.13 peers. NOTE: 0.7.* peers are no longer supported. Everyone should
update to 0.8.13 as a stable version now, and be prepared to update to the 0.9
branch when it is declared stable.

As the NRS javascript UI will no longer be developed, and nobody has the time
to convert it to use a BigInteger javascript library, it still accepts amounts
and fees in NXT, which are converted to NQT on the server side. Return values
are in NQT, and may result in overflow in the javascript for amounts exceeding
2^53 NQT (around 90 million NXT). Such overflow should only affect the UI,
inputs are handled as strings and converted to longs on the server side. Still,
for transactions of such size, better stay with the stable 0.8.13 branch, or
use a different client. 

At first run on main net, just like it did on test net, the database version
code will update the amounts and fees columns in the block and transaction
tables to NQT, which will take some time. During that process the database
size will temporarily increase a lot, to around 1 GB. It will shrink back at
shutdown (which again takes some time), to around 180 MB.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.2e:

Fractional asset quantities. Enjoy another reset of testnet.

When issuing an asset, the maximum allowed number of digits after the asset
quantity decimal point can be specified as "decimals" parameter (allowed
values 0 to 8). For example, this would be 2 for a currency like EUR, 8 for
Bitcoin.

Similar to prices, asset quantities can be specified either as quantityQNT,
expressed in the smallest possible quantity unit ("quant") for the specific
asset, or as quantityINT, expressed in whole asset units (which may however
contain a fractional part despite its name).
For example, 9.97 USD can be expressed as either quantityINT="9.97", or
quantityQNT="997", assuming decimals=2 for USD.

JSON responses containing quantities or asset balances are again returned in
both quantityINT and quantityQNT, as strings.

When placing an ask or bid order, if quantityQNT is specified, the price is
interpreted to apply to QNT quantity units (regardless of whether the price
itself was specified in NXT or in NQT). If quantityINT is specified, the
price is interpreted to apply to INT quantity units.
For example, a bid order for quantityQNT="300", priceNXT="2", for asset USD
will be interpreted as $3.00 at 1 cent = 2 NXT, i.e. 200 NXT for one dollar,
600 NXT total.
If parameters are submitted as quantityINT="7", priceNXT="50", the order will
be for $7.00 at 50 NXT for one dollar, 350 NXT total.

Internally order matching and tracking of account asset balances is always
done in quantityQNT. An unfortunate side effect for now is that when placing
an order using quantityINT, the calculated price in NQT for one QNT unit must
be an integer.
So you cannot place an order for quantityINT="1", priceNXT="10.12345678"
(or equivalently priceNQT="1012345678"), because then the price of one 
quantityQNT will be 10123456.78 NQT. The priceNXT will have to be either
10.12345600 or 10.12345700. If this is confusing, specify the order as
quantityQNT="100", priceNQT="10123456".


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.1e:

Always return amounts in both NXT and NQT, represented in the JSON as strings.

Refactoring of the JSON generating code, removed getJSONObject from Block and
Transaction.

Transactions causing block generation to fail will always be removed from the
unconfirmed transactions pool.

Fixed overflow in hallmark weight calculation.

Fixed transaction JSON parsing bug.

All testnet nodes should be updated to this release.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.9.0e:

This is an experimental preview release, which will only run on testnet.
It will refuse to start on main net, so don't try it there. However, all
testnet nodes should be updated to 0.9.0e, so that we can start testing
transactions with fractional NXT amounts.

All transaction amounts and fees will begin to be handled in NQT, 10^-8 NXT,
starting from the NQT_BLOCK, which for test net is set to height 63000.
When we do the transition on main net, it will be done in several steps, to
preserve compatibility with older versions, and of course not to reset the
main blockchain. This should also be tried on testnet first, so expect at
least one more reset of testnet later. But for this release on testnet,
existing assets will again be deleted, blockchain reset back to block 63000,
and fractional amounts and asset exchange enabled immediately at block 63000.

Implementation details:
Internally, all amounts are handled in NQT, using Java longs (64-bit). The
database amount and fee columns will also be converted to NQT stored as
BIGINT. This change is for both old (before NQT_BLOCK) and new transactions.
Only when verifying the signatures, old transactions and blocks are
represented in bytes using int (32-bit) instead of long amounts and fees.
For peer to peer compatibility, transaction JSON for old transactions will
contain amounts both in NQT and in NXT.
To prevent overflows, all additions and multiplications of longs are done
using precondition testing methods, Convert.safeAdd and Convert.safeMultiply,
which check for possible overflow before doing the operation.

All relevant Java APIs have been renamed to indicate that the value returned
is in NQT, except for getEffectiveBalanceNXT which is only used when forging
and there it is needed in NXT.

The http API has been changed to accept amounts either in NQT or in NXT,
with fractional amounts received as strings in the http request parameters
and then parsed directly to longs. The returned JSON objects use NQT only.
All relevant http parameter names and JSON parameters have been changed to
indicate whether they are in NQT or NXT.

Asset prices are also changed to use NQT, instead of NXT-cents. But I have
not tested asset exchange transactions at all, I have only tested simple
send money transactions, so expect bugs.

Fractional asset quantities are not yet implemented.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.13:

Prevent duplicate hash transactions in the unconfirmed transactions pool.

Added a comment field to the Asset Transfer transaction type, up to 1000 chars.
This will force a deletion of all blocks on testnet starting from the first one
that contains an asset transfer transaction, the first time this new version
is started.

Added optional filtering by account to the getUnconfirmedTransactions API.

Added getAllOpenOrders API request.

Added AccountAsset Listeners to Account, to receive notification of asset
balance changes specifying the asset that changed balance.

Return an error on trying to broadcast an insufficient funds transaction,
and do not try to re-broadcast such transactions.

Improvements to the DebugTrace and VerifyTrace facility.

Updated Jetty to version 9.1.3.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.12:

This release is only about testing and debugging. There is no need to
upgrade if you are not interested in doing testing.

Added DebugTrace.java, which uses listeners to monitor all changes to
account balances and asset balances, and all the events that cause
those changes - transactions, block generation fees, order placement,
asset issuance, asset transfer, order cancellation, trade.

This feature uses two new properties in nxt-default.properties:
nxt.debugTraceLog=nxt.trace
nxt.debugTraceAccounts=

To enable tracing of account balances, set nxt.debugTraceAccounts to
a list of account id's to be tracked, separated by "; " . The output
will be saved to nxt.trace, or the file defined in nxt.debugTraceLog.
Values in this file are tab-separated, to make it easy to import into
a spreadsheet application.

It is possible to enable tracing of all existing account balances, by
setting nxt.debugTraceAccount=* .

On restart, and also on rescan, the nxt.trace log will be overwritten.

Added VerifyTrace.java, which can parse the nxt.trace file (or a file
specified as a command line argument), and perform some verifications.
Currently, it verifies that for each traced account, the final balance
matches the total of all changes that affect that account, as
recorded in the nxt.trace log. It also verifies that for each asset,
the total of asset quantities in all accounts matches the original
quantity of asset issued. This verification can be expected to fail if
not all accounts that own an asset are included in debugTraceAccounts.

To run VerifyTrace, use the verify.sh script. The Nxt server should be
stopped first, so that the nxt.trace log does not continue to be
updated while VerifyTrace is verifying it.

Unconfirmed balances and unconfirmed asset balances are logged, but
not verified by VerifyTrace, because the presence of open or partially
filled orders can make that too complicated. It may be easier to
program a spreadsheet application to handle such calculations.

Added TRADE event, triggered when a Trade occurs. Note that the Trade
event happens before the update of the account balances.

Added BEFORE_BLOCK_APPLY and BEFORE_BLOCK_UNDO events, triggered just
before the corresponding operations in block processing.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.11:

Allow non-unique asset names.

Added getAssetsByName API call returning a list of all assets
with given assetName.

Added getAllTrades API call returning all trades starting from
a given timestamp (contributed by Antanst).

Improved the JSON responses for several API calls:
getAsset now also returns numberOfTrades. getAccount now also
returns unconfirmedBalance. broadcastTransaction now also returns
transaction hash. getAsk/BidOrder now also returns order height.
Performance of getTrades should be greatly improved, and it also
returns block id for each trade.

Explicitly stop all jetty servers when Nxt.shutdown() is called.

Escape text inserted as peer software or peer announced address
in the NRS client html, to prevent cross-site scripting and
related attacks by malicious peers.

Now that Crypto.sign() never produces bad signatures, no need
for additional call to verify() after block sign, or for
multiple transaction sign attempts.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.10:

Better transaction attachment validation. Blocks that incorrectly
got accepted but later fail to be processed for any reason, will
be deleted from the database.

Better validation of minimum fee for different transaction type.

GetAccount API will also return unconfirmed asset balances.

BroadcastTransaction now verifies the signature of received
transaction bytes before broadcasting the transaction.

Removed forging code no longer in use. Generating blocks below
height 30000 (transparent forging phase 1) is no longer supported.

Made Db.getConnection() public and added Blockchain.getBlocks and
getTransactions methods taking PreparedStatement as parameter,
for use by Java API clients.

Added an APITestServlet for manual debugging and testing of the
API. All http API calls will now automatically be listed under:

http://localhost:7876/test

or if you need to try only a specific one, e.g. getBalance:

http://localhost:7876/test?requestType=getBalance

Unlike the admin.html page, this listing is automatically
generated and will include all available API calls without
having to be manually updated when a new one is added.

Applied the patch to Curve25519.sign() suggested by DoctorEvil.
Block and transaction signing should no longer fail to verify.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.9:

Client-side transaction signing support. All http API requests that
create a new transaction, now accept either a secretPhrase or a 
publicKey parameter. If secretPhrase is supplied, transaction is
created, signed at the server, and broadcasted by the server as
usual. If secretPhrase is not supplied, but a publicKey parameter
is, as a hex encoded byte array, the transaction will be prepared
by the server and returned in the JSON response as transactionBytes.
This byte array can now be signed by the client, and then sent back
to the server for broadcasting using the broadcastTransaction API.

Transaction hashes, which can be used to uniquely identify transactions
to avoid transaction signature malleability attacks, can now be
obtained using Transaction.getHash(), and are also available in the
JSON representation of transactions. The hash can also be used to retrieve
a transaction from the server, instead of using transaction id, by
supplying a hash parameter to the getTransaction http API instead of
transaction parameter.

For improving performance, getBlockId and getBlockTimestamp Java API
methods have been added to the Transaction class, to avoid the need
to call getBlock which may require additional database query. Java
clients should use those instead of going through getBlock.
Similarly, the blockTimestamp field has been added to the JSON returned
by getTransaction and the other API calls that return a transaction
JSON, so http clients can also avoid unnecessary calls to getBlock.

Upgrading to 0.8.9 will modify the database to add the hash and
block_timestamp columns to the transaction table.

Transactions that have become invalid will now also be removed from the
re-broadcasting pool.

Moved all global constants to Constants.java.

Improved transaction validation for Asset Issuance transactions to
avoid misleading invalid transaction errors.

Corrected handling of transactions with identical timestamps in block
generation and in the NRS client UI.

Added ASSET_BALANCE and UNCONFIRMED_ASSET_BALANCE events to Account,
fixed possible problem with asset balance calculation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.8:

Fixed incorrect setting of genesis block timestamp when
local time is in the daylight savings period. This must
have been the reason for users in the southern hemisphere
being unable to forge.

Since DST in the US starts March 09, it is critical that
at least those in the US upgrade to 0.8.8 or 0.7.7.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.7:

Fixed unconfirmed balance calculations for the genesis block
account.

Fixed the display of the genesis account balance in the NRS UI.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.6:

Transaction re-broadcasting has been broken for a few releases,
should work again now.

Fixed the update of the NRS UI transaction confirmation count.

Check for unconfirmed transaction becoming invalid, and if so,
remove them from the unconfirmed transactions pool.

Added a few more well known testnet peers in default properties.

Converted run.bat to CRLF line endings format.

Asset exchange specific bugfixes:

Order cancellations should update unconfirmed balances only.

On block pop-off, asset balances should not be updated.

When a trade is executed at a price lower than the bid order,
correct the bidder unconfirmed balance for the difference.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.5:

More bugfixes related to unconfirmed balance calculation.

Minor fixes to avoid some harmless exceptions.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nxt-client-0.8.4e:

Several changes in the calculation of unconfirmed balances and
unconfirmed asset balances. This is an attempt to fix the
negative unconfirmed balance bug and "Not enough funds" error,
but hasn't been tested, this is why this release is experimental.

Enabled use of testnet just by setting nxt.isTestnet property
in nxt.properties. No other changes are needed.

When switching to testnet by setting nxt.isTestnet=true, peer
port becomes 6874, UI port 6875, and API server port 6876.
Those values are hardcoded to prevent mistakes and take
precedence over any custom port values in nxt.properties.
Also, when NOT using testnet, the server will refuse to start
if peer port is set to 6874, again to prevent accidental
mixing of real and test blockchains.

For testnet, a new subdirectory for the test blockchain will
be automatically created, nxt_test_db.

You need to set nxt.testnetPeers to a list of known public
test nodes. I have set up bug.airdns.org with the 0.8.4e code,
and a copy of the testnet blockchain, as obtained from holms.
I hope other people will also set up test nodes and announce
them on the forum.

In this release, when switching to test net, the Voting and
Asset Exchange features will be automatically enabled. On the
real net, they will still be disabled. The NRS UI client
however doesn't support those features, so you would need to
use a different UI, or use the http API directly.

Added nxt.knownBlacklistedPeers parameter, for manual
blacklisting of peers in the nxt.properties file.

No longer overwrite the peer address with its announced
address in the Active peers panel, use only the IP to uniquely
identify a peer.

Allow disabling of the DoSFilter for the peer networking
server. Added nxt.peerServerDoSFilter.maxRequestMs=300000
parameter, because the default value for the DoSFilter
maxRequestMs forcefully closes peer requests taking longer
than 30 s, which breaks blockchain downloads for slow peers.
This is very likely the cause for the Jetty error warnings
we had back in 0.5.x days.

Added Generator.getAccount method, and START_FORGING and
STOP_FORGING events, of interest to Java API clients.

Added run.bat script for Windows users.

Source code is now included in the release package under
the src directory. The compile.sh and javadoc.sh scripts
can be used to compile the source, and regenerate nxt.jar
and the javadoc documentation.

Change log:

Improved handling of peer announced addresses and ports. Setting
nxt.myAddress is now optional, which will help users with dynamic IP
addresses. When connecting to a peer, as long as nxt.shareMyAddress is
enabled, it will at a later time attempt to connect to your announced
address, or if not set, to the address your request came from.
If successful, the peer will use this address to connect to you in the
future, and will share it with others. This also does verification of
announced addresses, and considers your node connected only after a 
successful connection to the announced address is made. This will prevent
invalid announced addresses from being spread to other peers too.

If you need to use a non-default port, the port has to be appended to your
announced address too. It does not need to be the same as
nxt.myPeerServerPort, so you can run the server on one port but forward
a different router port to it. If the port is not set in announced address
however, but nxt.myPeerServerPort is non-default, nxt.myPeerServerPort
will automatically be appended to the announced address.

To summarize: For users with dynamic IPs, you don't need to put anything
in nxt.myAddress, but still need to set up port forwarding at your router.

Verification of hallmarks has also been improved to attempt to resolve
hostnames to IP addresses. Note that if you use a non-default port,
the hallmark should include your address only, without the port.

Added generateToken API request. Parameters are secretPhrase and website,
response is the token string wrapped in JSON. This is also available
on the admin.html page.

Improved handling of init and shutdown. Nxt.shutdown() is now public and
client developers can call it. When Nxt is started as a standalone
application by calling main(), it will schedule a shutdown hook, otherwise
if started using init(), the caller of init() is responsible for calling
shutdown() or scheduling a shutdown hook.

Delayed starting the blockchain scan and the jetty servlets until the
initialization of all classes has completed. This should allow registering
listeners with those, and will also help prevent errors due to servlets
starting to accept requests before the system is fully initialized.

If nxt-default.properties is not found in the classpath, Nxt will also
make an attempt to load it from the file defined in the system property
nxt-default.properties, so you can define it on the command line:
java -Dnxt-default.properties=conf/nxt-default.properties. This is of
interest to client developers only.

Support use of POST in addition to GET for all API and UI http requests.
To enforce use of POST only, for those requests that require the user
secretPhrase, the nxt.properties nxt.apiServerEnforcePOST and
nxt.uiServerEnforcePOST can be set (default is false for API, true for
UI). This way client developers can enforce that only POST requests are 
used for handling sensitive data.

The default NRS browser UI has been changed to use POST only, and so have
the tools - admin.html, message.html, alias.html. This way the user
secretPhrase will no longer be cached in the browser memory.

Release 0.8.0e

Change log:

This release introduces a major change in the Nxt server architecture.
Instead of being a servlet run by Jetty, Nxt is now a standalone
application which itself launches Jetty servlets, when needed.
This should make it easier to use as a Java library, as it no longer
needs to be run inside a servlet container.

The Nxt configuration has been made more flexible, both for the end user
and for application developers. Nxt no longer uses web.xml, or any xml
files for that matter. Instead, a user-friendly properties file is used.

The layout of the distribution has been changed and simplified. Unpacking
the zip file will produce the following directory structure:

nxt/conf/
This is where the configuration files are kept. All default properties
are in conf/nxt-default.properties. You should never edit this file,
unless you are a packager or client developer who needs different
defaults for his distribution.
All default values are reasonable, so Nxt can just be started without
any configuration. If however the end user wants to customize some
parameters, the way to do that is to create another properties file,
conf/nxt.properties, containing ONLY the properties that need to be
different from the defaults. Nxt will read both nxt-default.properties
and nxt.properties, and the values in nxt.properties will override those
in nxt-default.properties.

nxt/html/
This contains the html files needed for the NRS javascript based client,
under html/nrs, the html-based tools such as admin.html and update.html
under html/tools, and the javadoc documentation for the Java API under
html/doc.

nxt/lib/
This is where all required Java libraries are kept - Jetty, H2 database,
and the JSON-simple library. All Jetty libraries that are not used by Nxt
are no longer included, which also results in a smaller distribution
package.

nxt/nxt.jar
This jar contains all compiled Nxt classes.

nxt/run.sh
This script is the simplest way to start Nxt, under Linux:
java -Xmx1024M -cp nxt.jar:lib/*:conf nxt.Nxt
As you can see, the classpath needs to include nxt.jar, all the jars under
lib, and the conf directory.

Notably missing are start.jar, webapps, and the Jetty configuration
directories, which are no longer needed.

In addition to the switch to embedded Jetty, significant refactoring of the
code has been done, which may be of interest to users of the Java API. The
changes are too many to describe here, but can be easily seen by comparing
the javadoc of 0.8.0 with that of the 0.7 branch. Most notably, interfaces
have been defined for the Block and Transaction classes, the Blockchain
class has been split into several classes, and the Peer and User classes
have also seen some clean up.

Client developers using the Java API can override any of the default
properties by submitting a custom Properties object to Nxt.init().

The configurable properties in nxt-default.properties are all documented in
the comments in that file. Some additional details about those:

Nxt will start up to three different Jetty servers, if needed.

The peer networking server accepts http requests from peers. It is only
started if nxt.shareMyAddress=true (which is the default). If you are behind
a firewall and don't have an externally visible IP, you can set this to false
to disable it.

The port and host interface of the peer server are configurable. If you set
a non-default port in nxt.peerServerPort, this will be appended to the address
you announce to peers (this address should be set in nxt.myAddress). Using
non-default peer networking port hasn't been tested much though.

For a machine with multiple network interfaces, now you can specify on which
interface to bind each server. By default, nxt.peerServerHost=0.0.0.0 so the
peer networking server listens on all interfaces.

There are no hardcoded nxt.wellKnownPeers in the default properties files.
You are supposed to set those to your own preferred peers in nxt.properties.
However, if none are set, a random selection of nxtcrypto.org and nxtbase.com
public nodes will be used.

The DoS Filter is enabled for the peer server only.

The API server accepts http/json API requests. By default, now it runs on port
7876, and listens on the local 127.0.0.1 interface only. If you run a public
node and want to accept API requests from anyone, set nxt.apiServerHost to
0.0.0.0, and nxt.allowedBotHosts to * (or empty).

The nxt.apiResourceBase points to a directory of static html files that are
also served by the API server. Developers of clients using the http/json API
will want to customize this to point to their client html and javascript files.

The Jetty Cross Origin Filter can be enabled for the API server by setting
nxt.apiServerCORS=true (disabled by default).

The UI server is used for the NRS javascript client UI. By default it runs on
port 7875 and accepts requests from localhost only. Client developers using
the same API calls as the NRS client (not the http/json ones) should customize
nxt.uiResourceBase to point to their client html and javascript files instead.

SSL can be enabled for both the API server and the UI server (default disabled).
If this is done, the corresponding ports will accept https requests only. There
is no way currently to have both http and https supported at the same time, but
this can be added, I just didn't see the need for it.
If you enable SSL, you need to set nxt.keyStorePath and nxt.keyStorePassword,
and obviously you need to have your own SSL certificate (self-signed or signed
by a CA) in a keystore file. I have only tested this with a self-signed
certificate.

Client developers using the Java API will probably want to disable both the
API server and the UI server, and for users without a visible IP address
even the peer server.

Debugging output is now disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting
nxt.debug=true. Exception stack traces will still be logged, as long as
nxt.enableStackTraces=true. I hope there will be none of those.

The connection to the database can be completely customized, as the full
jdbc url used to connect to it is exposed in the properties file and can be
modified. Client developers that insist on being able to access the database
from a separate process, while Nxt is running, can do so by appending
;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE to the jdbc url, which will enable automatic mixed-mode.
This is disabled by default, but if you enable it and write to the database
while Nxt is running, expect things to break.

It is also possible to have the database in a different location, not just
in the current working directory, if you change the jdbc url accordingly.

To change the amount of memory used for the database cache, use the
nxt.dbCacheKB parameter, in kilobytes. If set to 0, by default 50 % of the
memory available to the JVM is used for database cache.

There have been no changes to the database schema, you should use your
existing nxt_db directory with this release too, instead of downloading
the blockchain from scratch.

This release is labeled experimental, but please try it. In particular, the
client developers and packagers should test it well, and if there are no
major issues, expect the 0.7 branch to become obsolete soon.

Compact the database at every shutdown. This should help reduce the size
of the nxt_db directory after the first run, check the before and after
disk usage.

Prevent duplicate peer listings in the known peers and blacklisted peers
frames.

Prevent a potential duplicate account key attack, of the type described
here:

Change log:

Another bugfix in the transition to Transparent Forging, starting from
block 67000. Upgrade before this block, because there will be a fork.

This release drops support for the old getMilestoneBlockIds protocol.
Clients older than 0.7.3 will not be able to request blocks from 0.7.4
nodes. Everybody needs to upgrade to 0.7.4 anyway, before block 67000.

Some optimizations in the database queries used during unlock account,
let's see if this helps Raspberry users.

Minor other improvements.

sha256: 8dccdaaf16d5f6714a96b05e08a918462cc3d549db66c7f52e81bc51b30894ae


Change log:

The 0.6.x series is no longer supported. Starting with this release,
only the database version will be developed.

Optimized the getMilestoneBlockIds protocol. This is the peer to peer
request that currently puts the most load on the public nodes, and is a
cause of a large amount of unnecessary outbound traffic. However, for
backwards compatibility, version 0.7.3 still supports both the old
and the improved getMilestoneBlockIds protocols, so when older clients
connect to 0.7.3 nodes they will still cause unnecessary load and
extra traffic, unfortunately.

WARNING: Support for the old getMilestoneBlockIds protocol will be
removed in 0.7.4. You don't need to upgrade immediately, but if
you don't do it before 0.7.4 comes out, your older version nodes
will not be able to request blocks and catch up with the blockchain.
Better upgrade sooner than later.

More and more refactoring. Completely separated the user interface logic
from the core business logic. Nothing in the core nxt package depends on
the classes in the nxt.user package anymore. Instead, a Listeners
framework is used, so that the UI can register to be notified of the
events in the core that it needs to know about. This is also intended to
be used by Java client API developers.

Added some more indexes to the database tables to improve performance.
These will be created automatically the first time this version is
started with your existing database - no need to start from scratch,
no need to delete your old nxt_db directory.

Privacy related change: Before this release, newly generated blocks
and new transactions were broadcasted to peers twice. This could allow
your peers to deduce that your node was the generator of the block or
transaction in question. This is now fixed. Note that somebody with
the ability to monitor all your internet traffic will still be able to
tell that it was you who generated a block, because the generating node
sends the block before having received it from any other peer. I don't
see a physically possible way to avoid that, yet. Also note that the
transaction re-broadcasting feature will continue to re-broadcast your
transactions until they are received back from at least one other node,
but will not do that with transactions received from other nodes. This
could still be used to deduce that your node was the source of a
transaction, in case the initial attempt to send it failed, and it was
re-broadcasted (but somebody already observed the failed first attempt).

Separated block forging logic into a Generator class, which can also
be used by Java API clients to start and stop forging.

Added startForging and stopForging API requests.
Parameters: secretPhrase, required for both starting and stopping.

Fixed minor bugs. Fixed a bug in peer download traffic monitoring.

sha256: cdb39d82e59aade4a0ea6b9f64fc9852fdab5d37a9a4ba755dffeaa96672aaf5


Change log:

Fixed a bug in the calculation of guaranteed balance which could in some
cases result in effective balance higher than the actual balance. Since
this change can produce a fork, a switch to the correct calculation will
happen at block 64000. Everyone should upgrade to either 0.7.1 or 0.6.2
before that block, or we will get forks.

Improved validation of peer addresses to prevent syntactically invalid or
unresolvable addresses from being included in the peers list.

Enabled logging of all debugging output to a log file. Everything printed
out to the console will also get logged to a file nxt.log. This should
help with submitting bug reports in case of crashes and errors, as it
doesn't matter anymore if your windows console just disappeared.
The nxt.log file is overwritten at every server restart.

Cleaned-up hallmark and authorization token processing. Added Token and
Hallmark classes, those can be now used by Java client developers to
generate and validate tokens and hallmarks without going through the http
interface.

Improved logging of block push failures and block pop-off events, those
will now print out the block id and the reason for block rejection.

Improved peer blacklisting and logging of reasons for blacklisting. Http
requests from blacklisted peers are now completely ignored.

Made all API request handling classes under the nxt.http package visible
in the javadoc documentation, to be used for documenting the parameters
and return values of the http API.

There haven't been any database related bugs in the 0.7 series. All the
above changes have been applied to both 0.6 and 0.7 branches. I encourage
more people to try the 0.7.1 version, there is no need to continue
maintaining the 0.6 branch very long if we don't encounter problems with
the database version.

Release 0.7.0e - experimental

http://download.nxtcrypto.org/nxt-client-0.7.0e.zip

sha256: aa778bade323d2b3f4cf13c925aa7b541d57f0853a5828385b72254ac92010bc

Change log:

This is the first release using an embedded java database (H2) to store
the blockchain, instead of serialized java object files. Because this is
a major change, this version is to be considered experimental.

The blocks.nxt and transactions.nxt and .bak files are no longer used.
Furthermore, they will not be loaded at startup, when you start with
empty database the very first time it will need to download the full
blockchain from the network.

The database is stored under the nxt_db directory, as of now it will
take around 100 MB when downloaded. If anything goes wrong and you need
to start fresh, it is safe to delete that nxt_db directory, it will be
recreated.

There are no changes in the web.xml file compared to 0.6.1. I will add
parameters to tweak database settings later, if needed.

The database will use 50% of the memory available to java for its cache.
The actual value is printed out at startup.

Currently only blocks and transactions are stored in database tables,
everything else such as accounts, aliases, assets, orders, messages,
is loaded at startup and then kept in memory. The amount of memory
those take is still small, relative to what was needed for all blocks
and transactions.

At startup, the blockchain scan takes a bit longer, this is normal.
If anything else is unusually slow, I will look into profiling and
optimizing it.

There are no new user-visible features compared to 0.6.1, the code is
kept in sync now (including the critical bugfixes). Having both 0.6.1
and 0.7.0e nodes on the network should not result in forks. I will
maintain both the 0.6.x and 0.7.x branches for some time, until all
major database related issues are discovered and fixed. Please report
bugs, including the stack traces.

Change log:

Fixed a critical bug. Everybody should upgrade immediately.
The fix in 0.5.12 was not enough.

A more detailed changelog will follow tomorrow, or you can
figure it out yourself. Now I go to sleep.

Did I mention that everyone should upgrade?

More detailed change log of 0.6.0:

The critical bugfix will still be disclosed later. This is only to document
the other changes from 0.5.12 to 0.6.0, as there are plenty of them.

The 0.5.x branch is really painful for me to work with, after getting used to
the fully refactored code in 0.6.x and 0.7.x. Therefore, I decided to stop
maintaining 0.5.x completely and move on to 0.6.x.

The last bugfix in 0.5.12 was not sufficient, and all forging users should
upgrade to 0.6.0 as soon as possible. 0.5.12 is broken and will not be fixed.

The 0.6.x branch still uses serialized object files, however those are not
backwards compatible with 0.5.x. Old blocks.nxt and transactions.nxt files
from 0.5.x will be imported automatically and converted to the new format
the first time 0.6.0 is run.

The blockchainStoragePath parameter in web.xml is no longer needed.

The code has been significantly refactored and is no longer a single java file.
All classes previously nested in Nxt have been moved out to their own files.

Everything is under a top level nxt package, and as a result the servlet-class
parameter in web.xml has to be changed to nxt.Nxt. Sorry that I forgot to
mention that when releasing 0.6.0:

<servlet-name>Nxt</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>nxt.Nxt</servlet-class>

There are three subpackages, nxt.user, nxt.peer, and nxt.http, with request
handlers in separate classes for all the UI, peer to peer, and http API
requests respectively. This completely replaces the old huge switch/case
statements in the servlet doGet and doPost methods.

All the business logic has been moved out of the Nxt servlet class.

A new Transaction.Type class hierarchy has been added to handle all logic
for transaction validation, transaction attachment handling, and transaction
application. This completely replaces the switch statements that used to
hold the transaction validation and processing logic.

Transaction undo, on block pop-off, has been implemented for transactions which
can be undone. For all others, an UndoNotSupportedException triggers a full
blockchain rescan.

A custom NxtException exception hierarchy is now used to help with block and
transaction validation. Most transaction and block parameters are now enforced
to be valid in the Transaction and Block constructors, which makes it sort of
difficult to forget to validate them.

Many minor and not so minor performance and memory optimizations, based on
actual profiling measurements, have been applied.

All field and method access modifiers have been reviewed. No java field or
method is more accessible than it needs to be. Everything that can be private,
is now private. Everything that should be final, is now final.

All JSON response and error handling has been cleaned up and optimized.

Unnecessary to and from ByteBuffer conversions in block and transaction
processing have been removed.

A deadline limit of not more than 1440 minutes for new transactions is now
enforced.

Peers that submit invalid block or transaction data are automatically
blacklisted.

Java API documentation is now available at http://localhost:7874/doc/ , all APIs
are subject to change as it is work in progress.

Minor UI changes: added warnings to the unlock account dialog and message.html,
added sendMoney to admin.html.

New or improved APIs:

getAccount
parameter: account (the account id)
returns: publicKey (if known), balance, effectiveBalance, all asset balances

getAsset
parameter: asset (the asset id)
returns: accountId of the asset issuer, asset name, description and quantity

getAssetIds
returns: all existing asset id's.

getAskOrderIds and getBidOrderIds now require an asset parameter, and return
the order id's for that asset only.

Change log:

Fixed performance problems in getState, getEffectiveBalance and
getGuaranteedBalance. The getGuaranteedBalance calculation now
uses a different algorithm and may in some cases give different
results than the 0.5.10 guaranteedBalance calculation which had
some bugs, so it is advisable that everyone upgrades to 0.5.11
to avoid the risk of a fork.

Fixed a bug with setting the public keys of accounts that forged
blocks without having any outgoing transactions.

sha256: 9cbe87450f6ed23f8cb881026e44dcee46108101c0de0d40989cbd6215ce233a

Change log:

This is a bugfix release. All users of 0.5.9 and earlier should upgrade.

Fixed a bug in Transparent Forging. The fix will take effect at block
51000. Users who don't upgrade by this block will be left out on a fork.

Fixed a minor bug in peer weight calculation.


Progress report:

The refactoring of 0.6.0 is going well. The Nxt project now consists of
86 java files instead of 1. I will proceed to work on persisting blocks
and transactions in a database some time next week. I do not plan to
release 0.6.0 until absolutely necessary, because it does not contain
any new user visible features and at this point is likely less stable
than the 0.5.x series. Urgent bugfixes and new API's, if needed, will
still be added to 0.5.x. Any Nxt clone projects that have been eagerly
awaiting the 0.6.x series, so that they can benefit from my refactoring
work for free, will have to continue waiting, while we make progress.

Change log:

Resolved all remaining thread concurrency issues in the block and
transaction handling. All reported null pointer exceptions, division by
zero, and related bugs should not happen anymore. If you see any
errors in the log at all, please report them in our bug database:
https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt-public/issues

Added Asset Exchange related APIs:
getAskOrder, getAskOrderIds, getBidOrder, getBidOrderIds,
getAccountCurrentAskOrderIds, getAccountCurrentBidOrderIds.

Prevent the Recent Blocks tab in the browser UI from growing beyond
60 blocks. This should help avoid browser slowdown and freeze during
downloading of the whole blockchain from scratch.

Added transaction re-broadcasting. To make sure a new transaction has
been received by the network, it is broadcasted every minute, until
it shows in the list of unconfirmed or confirmed transactions.

The debug logs are quiet now, in fact I haven't seen any exceptions in
the last 24 h of testing this release. Everybody should give it a try as
I hope this is a really stable release. In particular, peers still
running the buggy 0.5.7 will get blacklisted if they don't upgrade,
because they keep broadcasting malformed JSON blocks and will be treated
as zombies.

Change log:

Fixed a thread concurrency issue which is the likely cause of the
OutOfMemory errors some have experienced. This is a critical bugfix,
users of 0.5.7 should upgrade to 0.5.8.

Added "type" and "subtype" filters to getAccountTransactionsIds API.

sha256: 20002edeaaf0ffab97ab2f969969acb4f8a9df35fe489361b44e5291d95a33a7

Change log:

After the optimizations in memory and CPU usage, this release is about
optimizing the networking. Instead of sending to all peers, data are
pushed to only 10 peers by default. The number is configurable in
web.xml, the sendToPeersLimit parameter. This should reduce the network
traffic, and should also significantly reduce the waiting time the user
experiences when sending out a transaction. Furthermore, sends are now
done in parallel, using a pool of 10 threads, which means slow peers
will not delay the sending to the rest.

A few of the exceptions found from the debug output have been fixed,
and some more networking exceptions known to be harmless will now be
ignored. The logs are much more quiet now even with debug enabled, so
I have decided to enable the nxt.debug parameter by default in nxt.ini.

Transparent Forging phase 2 starts at block 47000. Everybody should
update to at least 0.5.7 before this block is reached, otherwise we
may see forks.

Added Wesley's send message tool, message.html.

Change log:

Cleaned up error logging and exception handling. There are now two system
properties that can be set to enable additional debug logging: nxt.debug
and nxt.enableStackTraces. Those are defined in start.d/nxt.ini:

	# Enable debug messages
	#-Dnxt.debug

	# Also enable exception stack traces
	-Dnxt.enableStackTraces

	# Disable all jetty warnings and info
	-Dorg.eclipse.jetty.LEVEL=OFF

By default, nxt.debug is disabled. If you watch your log, please do
enable debug output by uncommenting the -Dnxt.debug line in nxt.ini,
and report any bugs using our JIRA issue tracker at Bitbucket:

https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt-public/issues

Please avoid submitting duplicate issues, check if a very similar bug
has already been reported first.

The nxt.enableStackTraces parameter activates printing out exception
stack traces in the log, independently of the nxt.debug setting, you
should leave it turned on.

With nxt.debug commented out, Nxt will still print some messages to
the log, but much fewer. If there is a critical exception, it will
be logged even if nxt.debug is not enabled.

The noisy Jetty logging of warnings is disabled and the log should be
much cleaner now. If you enjoy seeing the Jetty warnings, comment out
the -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.LEVEL=OFF line in start.d/nxt.ini, but don't
report those as bugs.

The reason this release is considered experimental is that I have
upgraded Jetty from 9.1.0 to 9.1.1.v20140108. People are encouraged
to try it to see if there are any incompatibilities with different
systems and Java versions.

sha256: aa20fb32fe7e6cda7debee59928d5aea8ff7c581c58a56ff68e8252eaf9368c7

Change log:

Added getGuaranteedBalance API:
http://localhost:7874/nxt?requestType=getGuaranteedBalance&account=account
&numberOfConfirmations=numberOfConfirmations
returns the balance of an account only considering transactions with
confirmation count >= numberOfConfirmations.

The API requests getAccountBlockIds and getAccountTransactionIds now return
sorted results.

Added getAccountPublicKey and getGuaranteedBalance to admin.html page.

More performance optimizations.

sha256: 56b84fbcaecedb276ca2ca478c2af0fe3177da184c53863a5fb37f2807d4e451


Change log:

Added Arbitrary Messages code, to be enabled at block 40000.

New API requests added:

getAliasId
http://localhost:7874/nxt?requestType=getAliasId&alias=alias
returns the id of the alias given alias name

getAccountBlockIds
http://localhost:/7874/nxt?requestType=getAccountBlockIds&account=account
&timestamp=timestamp
returns the blockIds generated by the account after timestamp

getState will now also return cumulativeDifficulty and totalEffectiveBalance.
This allows the chance of an account to forge a block to be calculated by the
user as myEffectiveBalance/totalEffectiveBalance.

Significant memory consumption and performance optimizations to reduce the load
on the GC and the total memory requirements. It should be possible to run with
-Xmx512M if needed, more is better but should not be necessary. I hope Raspberry
users will be happy with this release.

This is experimental because of the multiple memory related optimizations, but
should perform better than 0.5.3.

sha256: c0676985f9ef08852250ba1d3fe980ee1392c3f70be6917f384f3636fa6f06e3

This is to be considered stable release. Change log:

Fixed more concurrency issues, performance optimizations and code cleanup.
I have fixed all the visible code issues that I consider to be bugs, the
remaining TODO's on my list are a matter of code cleanup and refactoring.

Added a checkpoint at block 30000 (the start of transparent forging block).

Added wesleyh's update checker:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=345619.msg4294180#msg4294180
Use https://localhost:7875/update.html to check for updates - this feature
may still have bugs, but including it in the package is a good way to get
people to test it on multiple browsers.

I have not been able to find any possible cause yet for the most critical
in my opinion bug reported so far, transactions being sent to a recipient
different than the one selected. I have read through the relevant code
again, but don't see any obvious way how this could happen. I am not
ignoring those reports and believe it may be a real bug and not a user
error, but without a way to reproduce the problem, it is very hard to
track it down.

nxt-client-0.4.9e:

Version 0.4.9e is available for download from:

sha256: 4e12df42f9f4727fa34eb62483880c0b2b93f45dfff4b4db8fdc293aecb815e9

From the blockchain, the alias for the sha256 sum is NRSbetaversion:

https://localhost:7875/nxt?requestType=getAliasURI&alias=nrsbetaversion

This is to be considered EXPERIMENTAL release. There are quite a few changes so
be careful. Stay with the stable 0.4.8 version if you don't want to take
chances. But our flagship NCC-1701-D has been running 0.4.9e since yesterday
without issues.

Change Log:

Many concurrency related fixes and optimization. Those should significantly
improve performance and stability and decrease the likelihood of the client
being stuck and needing a restart.

Performance optimizations, reducing the number of temporary objects being
created in the peer networking, making sure connections are properly closed.
Memory requirements are lower now, my servers never exceed 1.5 GB. You should be
able to run it on a 2 GB VPS node with -Xmx1536M without problems now. If you
don't attract a lot of traffic (don't publish your IP), memory will even stay
below 1GB.

Unlocking an account now makes sure to automatically lock out all other
instances of the same account on the same server. In other words, if you open
several browser windows to the same server (localhost), you can only be logged
in to the same account in one of them at a time. This does not prevent you
however from unlocking the same account on multiple machines (but you shouldn't
be doing that).

Generate authorization token will also ask for a secret phrase confirmation
again.

As you may or may have not noticed, Transparent Forging has already started. My
last minute decision to start at 32000 somehow didn't make it in the package I
released as 0.4.8 (I make mistakes too), so 0.4.8 got released with the
switchover still at 30000. So block 30000 it is now, and we are already there.

Minor changes: Added Get Account Aliases, Get Alias URI, and Get Multiple
Account Balances features to the https://localhost:7875/admin.html page. Added a
few more well-known nodes to the default in the web.xml.

There is one serious security issue which is not completely fixed in 0.4.9e. All
requests URLs are being cached by the browser, and even though they don't appear
in the browsing history (which is why we didn't discover the problem earlier),
they are still in the browser cache. Check for yourself using about:cache on
firefox. This is bad, as it means your secret phrase is being written out to
disk as plain text in the browser cache. And I am sure javascript exploits will
appear which will try to extract it from there. To really fix that, all API
requests from the browser that include the secret phrase have to be sent as
POST, rather than GET requests. But this will require some significant changes
to the javascript client, which will take some time. As we don't plan to
maintain the current javascript client, I am not sure if such rewriting should
even be undertaken now. In 0.4.9e I at least added the response headers which
prevent caching to disk. Firefox honors those, but still caches the request URLs
to memory. To be safe, I strongly suggest using a separate browser profile only
for accessing your Nxt client, or private browsing mode. Everybody using 0.4.8
and earlier should immediately delete their browser cache.
