# This example file shows how to configure Nxt client to work with testnet.

# Use testnet. Don't set this unless you are really testing.
# When using testnet, all custom port settings will be ignored, and hardcoded
# ports of 6874 (peer networking), 6875 (UI) and 6876 (API) will be used.
# Never unlock your real accounts on testnet! Use separate accounts for testing
# only.
nxt.isTestnet=true
